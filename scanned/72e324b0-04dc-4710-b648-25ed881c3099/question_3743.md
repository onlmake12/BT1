# Q3743: High vm cross module inconsistency in Debugger

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a malicious script spawning or execing child processes with adversarial inherited descriptors and pipes to make `Debugger` in `script/src/syscalls/debugger.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make a syscall expose bytes that differ from consensus-resolved transaction data, violating scripts must see exactly the resolved cells, headers, witnesses, and block extensions committed by consensus, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/syscalls/debugger.rs::Debugger`
- Entrypoint: a malicious script spawning or execing child processes with adversarial inherited descriptors and pipes
- Attacker controls: malformed buffers, return codes, memory pointers, and script group composition
- Exploit idea: make a syscall expose bytes that differ from consensus-resolved transaction data
- Invariant to test: scripts must see exactly the resolved cells, headers, witnesses, and block extensions committed by consensus
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

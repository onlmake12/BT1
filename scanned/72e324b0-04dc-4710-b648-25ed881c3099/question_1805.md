# Q1805: Critical network limit off by one in poll

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs through a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records so `poll` in `network/src/services/dump_peer_store.rs` trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload, violating malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/services/dump_peer_store.rs::poll`
- Entrypoint: a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records
- Attacker controls: compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs
- Exploit idea: trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload
- Invariant to test: malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

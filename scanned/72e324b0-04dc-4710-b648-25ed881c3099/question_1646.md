# Q1646: High network cross module inconsistency in Feeler

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads to make `Feeler` in `network/src/protocols/feeler.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload, violating peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/protocols/feeler.rs::Feeler`
- Entrypoint: a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads
- Attacker controls: message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths
- Exploit idea: trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload
- Invariant to test: peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

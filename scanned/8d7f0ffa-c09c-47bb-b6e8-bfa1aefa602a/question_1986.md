# Q1986: High network canonical encoding ambiguity in BlockProcess

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs through a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads so `BlockProcess` in `sync/src/synchronizer/block_process.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied, violating P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/synchronizer/block_process.rs::BlockProcess`
- Entrypoint: a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads
- Attacker controls: compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs
- Exploit idea: cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied
- Invariant to test: P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

# Q2737: Medium storage batch interaction bug in insert_cells

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch database column contents derived from accepted blocks, freezer boundaries, migration versions, and write-batch size through a sync peer causing repeated rollback, truncation, migration, or state lookup edge cases so `insert_cells` in `store/src/write_batch.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and force large storage or lookup amplification with a small number of valid blocks or transactions, violating cell/header/transaction metadata must match the verified chain and never expose stale spendability, causing Medium (2001 - 10000 points). Suboptimal implementation of CKB state storage mechanism?

## Target
- File/function: `store/src/write_batch.rs::insert_cells`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer causing repeated rollback, truncation, migration, or state lookup edge cases
- Attacker controls: database column contents derived from accepted blocks, freezer boundaries, migration versions, and write-batch size
- Exploit idea: force large storage or lookup amplification with a small number of valid blocks or transactions
- Invariant to test: cell/header/transaction metadata must match the verified chain and never expose stale spendability
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium (2001 - 10000 points). Suboptimal implementation of CKB state storage mechanism
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

# Q836: High core resource amplification in sync

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs through a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data to make `sync` in `util/constant/src/sync.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and break a resource bound or state transition that downstream modules assume is already enforced, violating caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/constant/src/sync.rs::sync`
- Entrypoint: a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data
- Attacker controls: message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs
- Exploit idea: break a resource bound or state transition that downstream modules assume is already enforced
- Invariant to test: caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

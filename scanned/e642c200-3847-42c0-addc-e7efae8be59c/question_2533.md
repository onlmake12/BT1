# Q2533: Medium storage canonical encoding ambiguity in Freezer

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for block order, reorg depth, cell lifetimes, transaction metadata, header maps, and snapshot timing through a sync peer causing repeated rollback, truncation, migration, or state lookup edge cases so `Freezer` in `freezer/src/freezer.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and force large storage or lookup amplification with a small number of valid blocks or transactions, violating state storage mechanisms must not allow cheap corruption, excessive growth, or crash-on-restart, causing Medium (2001 - 10000 points). Suboptimal implementation of CKB state storage mechanism?

## Target
- File/function: `freezer/src/freezer.rs::Freezer`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer causing repeated rollback, truncation, migration, or state lookup edge cases
- Attacker controls: block order, reorg depth, cell lifetimes, transaction metadata, header maps, and snapshot timing
- Exploit idea: force large storage or lookup amplification with a small number of valid blocks or transactions
- Invariant to test: state storage mechanisms must not allow cheap corruption, excessive growth, or crash-on-restart
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium (2001 - 10000 points). Suboptimal implementation of CKB state storage mechanism
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

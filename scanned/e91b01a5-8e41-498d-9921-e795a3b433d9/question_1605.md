# Q1605: Critical network state transition mismatch in received

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages and sequence peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing so `received` in `network/src/protocols/disconnect_message.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied, violating sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/protocols/disconnect_message.rs::received`
- Entrypoint: a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages
- Attacker controls: peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing
- Exploit idea: cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied
- Invariant to test: sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

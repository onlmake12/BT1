# Q3129: Critical transaction state transition mismatch in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a tx-pool submitter racing mempool admission against chain reorg or cell status changes and sequence cell deps, header deps, witnesses, lock/type args, output data lengths, and capacity values so `lib` in `util/occupied-capacity/src/lib.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization, violating resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `util/occupied-capacity/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a tx-pool submitter racing mempool admission against chain reorg or cell status changes
- Attacker controls: cell deps, header deps, witnesses, lock/type args, output data lengths, and capacity values
- Exploit idea: bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization
- Invariant to test: resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

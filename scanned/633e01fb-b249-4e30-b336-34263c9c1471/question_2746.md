# Q2746: High storage batch interaction bug in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch block order, reorg depth, cell lifetimes, transaction metadata, header maps, and snapshot timing through a peer-driven chain/reorg sequence that writes adversarial canonical and fork state so `lib` in `util/migrate/src/lib.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and make persisted state disagree with canonical verification state after restart or rollback, violating persisted CKB state must remain canonical, recoverable, and internally consistent across reorg/restart, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/migrate/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a peer-driven chain/reorg sequence that writes adversarial canonical and fork state
- Attacker controls: block order, reorg depth, cell lifetimes, transaction metadata, header maps, and snapshot timing
- Exploit idea: make persisted state disagree with canonical verification state after restart or rollback
- Invariant to test: persisted CKB state must remain canonical, recoverable, and internally consistent across reorg/restart
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

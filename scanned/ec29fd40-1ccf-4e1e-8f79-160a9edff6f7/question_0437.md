# Q437: Critical consensus parser precheck gap in utils

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit malformed-but-reachable genesis/spec fields on a private chain and canonical block metadata during replay through a sync peer delivering reordered headers, uncles, and block extensions so `utils` in `chain/src/utils/mod.rs` performs expensive or unsafe work before validation and make fork-choice or delayed verification commit a block whose derived roots or epoch data disagree with recalculation, violating all honest nodes must deterministically accept and reject the same blocks under the same consensus spec, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/src/utils/mod.rs::utils`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering reordered headers, uncles, and block extensions
- Attacker controls: genesis/spec fields on a private chain and canonical block metadata during replay
- Exploit idea: make fork-choice or delayed verification commit a block whose derived roots or epoch data disagree with recalculation
- Invariant to test: all honest nodes must deterministically accept and reject the same blocks under the same consensus spec
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

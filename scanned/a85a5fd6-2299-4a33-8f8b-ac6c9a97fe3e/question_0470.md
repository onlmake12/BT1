# Q470: Critical consensus cross module inconsistency in EaglesongPowEngine

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a sync peer delivering reordered headers, uncles, and block extensions to make `EaglesongPowEngine` in `pow/src/eaglesong.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where force two verification paths to classify the same block differently around a boundary check, violating invalid PoW, epoch, uncle, proposal, extension, DAO, or root data must never become canonical, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `pow/src/eaglesong.rs::EaglesongPowEngine`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering reordered headers, uncles, and block extensions
- Attacker controls: header timestamp, compact target, epoch fraction, nonce, parent hash, and block number
- Exploit idea: force two verification paths to classify the same block differently around a boundary check
- Invariant to test: invalid PoW, epoch, uncle, proposal, extension, DAO, or root data must never become canonical
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

# Q376: High consensus cross module inconsistency in drop

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a sync peer delivering reordered headers, uncles, and block extensions to make `drop` in `chain/src/init.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where force two verification paths to classify the same block differently around a boundary check, violating fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/src/init.rs::drop`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering reordered headers, uncles, and block extensions
- Attacker controls: fork order, orphan arrival timing, hardfork activation boundary, and reorg depth
- Exploit idea: force two verification paths to classify the same block differently around a boundary check
- Invariant to test: fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

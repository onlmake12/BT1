# Q3014: Critical transaction batch interaction bug in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch maturity height, since flags, DAO fields, resolved transaction data, and duplicate dependencies through a script author referencing edge-case cells, headers, DAO data, and occupied-capacity values so `lib` in `traits/src/lib.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and make non-contextual, contextual, and tx-pool verification disagree about the same transaction, violating tx-pool admission and block verification must not diverge for security-relevant validity, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `traits/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a script author referencing edge-case cells, headers, DAO data, and occupied-capacity values
- Attacker controls: maturity height, since flags, DAO fields, resolved transaction data, and duplicate dependencies
- Exploit idea: make non-contextual, contextual, and tx-pool verification disagree about the same transaction
- Invariant to test: tx-pool admission and block verification must not diverge for security-relevant validity
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

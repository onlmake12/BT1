# Q2598: High storage limit off by one in notify_controller

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for block order, reorg depth, cell lifetimes, transaction metadata, header maps, and snapshot timing through a node receiving valid-looking blocks that stress snapshots, caches, freezer, and write batches so `notify_controller` in `shared/src/shared.rs` force large storage or lookup amplification with a small number of valid blocks or transactions, violating persisted CKB state must remain canonical, recoverable, and internally consistent across reorg/restart, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `shared/src/shared.rs::notify_controller`
- Entrypoint: a node receiving valid-looking blocks that stress snapshots, caches, freezer, and write batches
- Attacker controls: block order, reorg depth, cell lifetimes, transaction metadata, header maps, and snapshot timing
- Exploit idea: force large storage or lookup amplification with a small number of valid blocks or transactions
- Invariant to test: persisted CKB state must remain canonical, recoverable, and internally consistent across reorg/restart
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

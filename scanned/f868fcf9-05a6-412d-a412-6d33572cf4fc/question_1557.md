# Q1557: High network cross module inconsistency in PeerScoreConfig

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks to make `PeerScoreConfig` in `network/src/peer_store/mod.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply, violating malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/peer_store/mod.rs::PeerScoreConfig`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks
- Attacker controls: header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses
- Exploit idea: desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply
- Invariant to test: malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

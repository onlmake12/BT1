# Q3553: Critical txpool batch interaction bug in TxPool

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch block template limits, tx selection order, uncle candidates, proposal IDs, and fee estimator samples through a local miner process selecting proposals and uncles near limit boundaries so `TxPool` in `tx-pool/src/persisted.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and make tx-pool policy accept a transaction that block verification later rejects, or reject valid traffic cheaply, violating block assembly must preserve consensus validity, proposal eligibility, reward, and fee accounting, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `tx-pool/src/persisted.rs::TxPool`
- Entrypoint: a local miner process selecting proposals and uncles near limit boundaries
- Attacker controls: block template limits, tx selection order, uncle candidates, proposal IDs, and fee estimator samples
- Exploit idea: make tx-pool policy accept a transaction that block verification later rejects, or reject valid traffic cheaply
- Invariant to test: block assembly must preserve consensus validity, proposal eligibility, reward, and fee accounting
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Simulate tx-pool submission, orphan/recent-reject transitions, and block-template assembly; assert bounded queues and consensus-valid output.

# Q683: High consensus parser precheck gap in disable_epoch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit malformed-but-reachable header timestamp, compact target, epoch fraction, nonce, parent hash, and block number through a remote peer relaying a crafted block/header sequence so `disable_epoch` in `verification/traits/src/lib.rs` performs expensive or unsafe work before validation and trigger an arithmetic, encoding, or target-conversion edge before the normal consensus rejection path, violating fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `verification/traits/src/lib.rs::disable_epoch`
- Entrypoint: a remote peer relaying a crafted block/header sequence
- Attacker controls: header timestamp, compact target, epoch fraction, nonce, parent hash, and block number
- Exploit idea: trigger an arithmetic, encoding, or target-conversion edge before the normal consensus rejection path
- Invariant to test: fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

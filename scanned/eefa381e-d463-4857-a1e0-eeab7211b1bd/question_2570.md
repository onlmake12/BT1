# Q2570: High storage resource amplification in BlockStatus

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small database column contents derived from accepted blocks, freezer boundaries, migration versions, and write-batch size through a node receiving valid-looking blocks that stress snapshots, caches, freezer, and write batches to make `BlockStatus` in `shared/src/block_status.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and trigger database/freezer/migration panic or unrecoverable state from attacker-shaped accepted data, violating database writes, freezer state, migrations, and snapshots must be atomic for security-relevant data, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `shared/src/block_status.rs::BlockStatus`
- Entrypoint: a node receiving valid-looking blocks that stress snapshots, caches, freezer, and write batches
- Attacker controls: database column contents derived from accepted blocks, freezer boundaries, migration versions, and write-batch size
- Exploit idea: trigger database/freezer/migration panic or unrecoverable state from attacker-shaped accepted data
- Invariant to test: database writes, freezer state, migrations, and snapshots must be atomic for security-relevant data
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

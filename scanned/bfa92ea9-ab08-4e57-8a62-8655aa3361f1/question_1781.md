# Q1781: Critical network differential path split in seeding

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `seeding` in `network/src/services/dns_seeding/mod.rs` through two production paths from a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages and make one path accept while the other rejects because of header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses, violating peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/services/dns_seeding/mod.rs::seeding`
- Entrypoint: a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages
- Attacker controls: header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses
- Exploit idea: cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied
- Invariant to test: peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

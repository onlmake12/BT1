# Q366: High consensus cross module inconsistency in insert_block

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a sync peer delivering reordered headers, uncles, and block extensions to make `insert_block` in `chain/src/chain_service.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where trigger an arithmetic, encoding, or target-conversion edge before the normal consensus rejection path, violating all honest nodes must deterministically accept and reject the same blocks under the same consensus spec, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/src/chain_service.rs::insert_block`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering reordered headers, uncles, and block extensions
- Attacker controls: genesis/spec fields on a private chain and canonical block metadata during replay
- Exploit idea: trigger an arithmetic, encoding, or target-conversion edge before the normal consensus rejection path
- Invariant to test: all honest nodes must deterministically accept and reject the same blocks under the same consensus spec
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

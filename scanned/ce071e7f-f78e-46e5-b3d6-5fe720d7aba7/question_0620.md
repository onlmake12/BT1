# Q620: High consensus cross module inconsistency in init_cache

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects to make `init_cache` in `verification/src/cache.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where force two verification paths to classify the same block differently around a boundary check, violating all honest nodes must deterministically accept and reject the same blocks under the same consensus spec, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `verification/src/cache.rs::init_cache`
- Entrypoint: an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects
- Attacker controls: uncle lists, proposal IDs, block extension bytes, transaction roots, and DAO fields
- Exploit idea: force two verification paths to classify the same block differently around a boundary check
- Invariant to test: all honest nodes must deterministically accept and reject the same blocks under the same consensus spec
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

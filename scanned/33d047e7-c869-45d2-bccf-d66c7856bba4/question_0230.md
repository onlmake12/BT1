# Q230: Low cli cross module inconsistency in is_enabled

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a local process starting, stopping, importing, exporting, replaying, or migrating CKB data to make `is_enabled` in `util/app-config/src/sentry_config.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where crash the command or node through supported local input before validation or recovery runs, violating import/export/replay/migration behavior must match production validation and storage invariants, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `util/app-config/src/sentry_config.rs::is_enabled`
- Entrypoint: a local process starting, stopping, importing, exporting, replaying, or migrating CKB data
- Attacker controls: local database contents, malformed config files, and supported operator commands
- Exploit idea: crash the command or node through supported local input before validation or recovery runs
- Invariant to test: import/export/replay/migration behavior must match production validation and storage invariants
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Run the supported CLI/config path in a temp directory with crafted local input; assert clean error, no state corruption, and bounded runtime.

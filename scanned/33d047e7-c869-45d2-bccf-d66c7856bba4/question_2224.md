# Q2224: High rpc canonical encoding ambiguity in batch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for indexer state freshness, reorg timing, block-filter requests, and proof target positions through an indexer/RPC client requesting adversarial ranges, filters, cursors, and pagination values so `batch` in `util/indexer/src/store/mod.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and cause locally submitted blocks/transactions to enter a path with weaker validation than P2P relay, violating RPC/indexer/helper state must match canonical chain state after reorg, restart, and pagination, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/indexer/src/store/mod.rs::batch`
- Entrypoint: an indexer/RPC client requesting adversarial ranges, filters, cursors, and pagination values
- Attacker controls: indexer state freshness, reorg timing, block-filter requests, and proof target positions
- Exploit idea: cause locally submitted blocks/transactions to enter a path with weaker validation than P2P relay
- Invariant to test: RPC/indexer/helper state must match canonical chain state after reorg, restart, and pagination
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.

# Q1117: Low core cross module inconsistency in as_advanced_builder

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data to make `as_advanced_builder` in `util/types/src/prelude.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make canonical serialization or conversion accept an ambiguous representation, violating security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/prelude.rs::as_advanced_builder`
- Entrypoint: a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data
- Attacker controls: conversion inputs, collection lengths, duplicate identifiers, empty values, and maximum-size payloads
- Exploit idea: make canonical serialization or conversion accept an ambiguous representation
- Invariant to test: security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

# Q1951: High network limit off by one in new

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing through a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads so `new` in `sync/src/relayer/get_block_proposal_process.rs` desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply, violating peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/relayer/get_block_proposal_process.rs::new`
- Entrypoint: a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads
- Attacker controls: peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing
- Exploit idea: desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply
- Invariant to test: peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

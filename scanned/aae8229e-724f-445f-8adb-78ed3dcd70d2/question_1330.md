# Q1330: Critical crypto state transition mismatch in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a script author relying on secp/multisig/hash utilities through system script behavior and sequence script args, witness lock fields, pubkey hash matching, and conversion boundaries so `lib` in `util/fixed-hash/src/lib.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow make verification accept a malformed signature/proof/hash that should be rejected, violating hash, Merkle, MMR, and fixed-byte conversions must be canonical across consensus and RPC paths, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `util/fixed-hash/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a script author relying on secp/multisig/hash utilities through system script behavior
- Attacker controls: script args, witness lock fields, pubkey hash matching, and conversion boundaries
- Exploit idea: make verification accept a malformed signature/proof/hash that should be rejected
- Invariant to test: hash, Merkle, MMR, and fixed-byte conversions must be canonical across consensus and RPC paths
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Add a property or unit test over signatures, hashes, proofs, and encodings; assert malformed variants reject without panic.

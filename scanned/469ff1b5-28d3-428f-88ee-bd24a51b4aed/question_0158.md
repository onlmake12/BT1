# Q158: Low cli cross module inconsistency in configs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use an operator using default-enabled configuration generated or parsed by the node to make `configs` in `util/app-config/src/configs/mod.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where cause important performance degradation in a default-enabled operator path with small local input, violating default-enabled configuration must preserve security, performance, and protocol assumptions, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `util/app-config/src/configs/mod.rs::configs`
- Entrypoint: an operator using default-enabled configuration generated or parsed by the node
- Attacker controls: runtime stop timing, spawned process handles, channel pressure, memory tracker samples, and data paths
- Exploit idea: cause important performance degradation in a default-enabled operator path with small local input
- Invariant to test: default-enabled configuration must preserve security, performance, and protocol assumptions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Run the supported CLI/config path in a temp directory with crafted local input; assert clean error, no state corruption, and bounded runtime.

# Q1079: High core state transition mismatch in from

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates and sequence message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs so `from` in `util/types/src/conversion/storage.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input, violating security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/conversion/storage.rs::from`
- Entrypoint: a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates
- Attacker controls: message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs
- Exploit idea: trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input
- Invariant to test: security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

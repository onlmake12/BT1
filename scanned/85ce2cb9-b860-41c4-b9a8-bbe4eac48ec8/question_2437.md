# Q2437: Low rpc limit off by one in fetch_count

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for block/template parameters, transaction payloads, fee-rate values, and debug/experiment options through a miner or wallet integration calling chain, pool, miner, net, debug, or subscription APIs so `fetch_count` in `util/rich-indexer/src/store.rs` amplify storage scans or proof generation with small crafted RPC requests, violating local RPC APIs must validate all caller-controlled parameters and fail without process crash, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `util/rich-indexer/src/store.rs::fetch_count`
- Entrypoint: a miner or wallet integration calling chain, pool, miner, net, debug, or subscription APIs
- Attacker controls: block/template parameters, transaction payloads, fee-rate values, and debug/experiment options
- Exploit idea: amplify storage scans or proof generation with small crafted RPC requests
- Invariant to test: local RPC APIs must validate all caller-controlled parameters and fail without process crash
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.

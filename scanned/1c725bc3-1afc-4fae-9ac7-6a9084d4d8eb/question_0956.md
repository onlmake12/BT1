# Q956: High core batch interaction bug in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior through an unprivileged peer, RPC caller, or transaction sender reaching this shared module through production paths so `lib` in `util/gen-types/src/lib.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input, violating caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `util/gen-types/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: an unprivileged peer, RPC caller, or transaction sender reaching this shared module through production paths
- Attacker controls: local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior
- Exploit idea: trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input
- Invariant to test: caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

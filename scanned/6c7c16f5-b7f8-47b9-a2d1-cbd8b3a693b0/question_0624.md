# Q624: Critical consensus differential path split in convert

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `convert` in `verification/src/convert.rs` through two production paths from an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects and make one path accept while the other rejects because of uncle lists, proposal IDs, block extension bytes, transaction roots, and DAO fields, violating all honest nodes must deterministically accept and reject the same blocks under the same consensus spec, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `verification/src/convert.rs::convert`
- Entrypoint: an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects
- Attacker controls: uncle lists, proposal IDs, block extension bytes, transaction roots, and DAO fields
- Exploit idea: make fork-choice or delayed verification commit a block whose derived roots or epoch data disagree with recalculation
- Invariant to test: all honest nodes must deterministically accept and reject the same blocks under the same consensus spec
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

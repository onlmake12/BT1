# Q735: High core limit off by one in is_pre

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for conversion inputs, collection lengths, duplicate identifiers, empty values, and maximum-size payloads through a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data so `is_pre` in `util/build-info/src/lib.rs` trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input, violating module-level assumptions must hold across consensus, network, RPC, storage, and tx-pool paths, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `util/build-info/src/lib.rs::is_pre`
- Entrypoint: a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data
- Attacker controls: conversion inputs, collection lengths, duplicate identifiers, empty values, and maximum-size payloads
- Exploit idea: trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input
- Invariant to test: module-level assumptions must hold across consensus, network, RPC, storage, and tx-pool paths
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

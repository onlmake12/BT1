# Q1057: Low core restart reorg persistence in constants

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior through a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates, then force normal restart, reorg, retry, or replay handling so `constants` in `util/types/src/constants.rs` persists inconsistent state and break a resource bound or state transition that downstream modules assume is already enforced, violating security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/constants.rs::constants`
- Entrypoint: a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates
- Attacker controls: local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior
- Exploit idea: break a resource bound or state transition that downstream modules assume is already enforced
- Invariant to test: security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

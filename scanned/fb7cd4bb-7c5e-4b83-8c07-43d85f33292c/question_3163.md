# Q3163: High transaction cross module inconsistency in build_filter

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a transaction sender submitting crafted inputs, outputs, deps, witnesses, and since values to make `build_filter` in `util/rich-indexer/src/indexer_handle/async_indexer_handle/get_transactions.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization, violating resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `util/rich-indexer/src/indexer_handle/async_indexer_handle/get_transactions.rs::build_filter`
- Entrypoint: a transaction sender submitting crafted inputs, outputs, deps, witnesses, and since values
- Attacker controls: canonical cell status before and after reorg, snapshot lookup results, and dep-group layout
- Exploit idea: bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization
- Invariant to test: resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

# Q370: Critical consensus resource amplification in ChainServiceScope

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small header timestamp, compact target, epoch fraction, nonce, parent hash, and block number through a sync peer delivering reordered headers, uncles, and block extensions to make `ChainServiceScope` in `chain/src/init.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and force two verification paths to classify the same block differently around a boundary check, violating fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/src/init.rs::ChainServiceScope`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering reordered headers, uncles, and block extensions
- Attacker controls: header timestamp, compact target, epoch fraction, nonce, parent hash, and block number
- Exploit idea: force two verification paths to classify the same block differently around a boundary check
- Invariant to test: fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

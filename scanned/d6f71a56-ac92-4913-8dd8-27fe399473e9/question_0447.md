# Q447: High consensus cross module inconsistency in with_capacity

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects to make `with_capacity` in `chain/src/utils/orphan_block_pool.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make contextual verification consume stale parent or epoch state after a reorg/orphan transition, violating fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/src/utils/orphan_block_pool.rs::with_capacity`
- Entrypoint: an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects
- Attacker controls: fork order, orphan arrival timing, hardfork activation boundary, and reorg depth
- Exploit idea: make contextual verification consume stale parent or epoch state after a reorg/orphan transition
- Invariant to test: fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

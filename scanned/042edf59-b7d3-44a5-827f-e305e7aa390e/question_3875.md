# Q3875: High vm limit off by one in Syscalls

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for malformed buffers, return codes, memory pointers, and script group composition through a block relayer executing transactions at VM-version or hardfork activation boundaries so `Syscalls` in `script/src/syscalls/pause.rs` make a syscall expose bytes that differ from consensus-resolved transaction data, violating cycle accounting and process state must remain bounded and cannot be bypassed by crafted scripts, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/syscalls/pause.rs::Syscalls`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer executing transactions at VM-version or hardfork activation boundaries
- Attacker controls: malformed buffers, return codes, memory pointers, and script group composition
- Exploit idea: make a syscall expose bytes that differ from consensus-resolved transaction data
- Invariant to test: cycle accounting and process state must remain bounded and cannot be bypassed by crafted scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

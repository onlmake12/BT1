# Q39: Low cli cache invalidation failure in init

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a local process starting, stopping, importing, exporting, replaying, or migrating CKB data to alternate valid and invalid local database contents, malformed config files, and supported operator commands so `init` in `ckb-bin/src/subcommand/init.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and trigger an import/export/replay/migrate path to disagree with normal node validation or storage state, violating operator-facing services must not crash or degrade the node through valid local inputs, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `ckb-bin/src/subcommand/init.rs::init`
- Entrypoint: a local process starting, stopping, importing, exporting, replaying, or migrating CKB data
- Attacker controls: local database contents, malformed config files, and supported operator commands
- Exploit idea: trigger an import/export/replay/migrate path to disagree with normal node validation or storage state
- Invariant to test: operator-facing services must not crash or degrade the node through valid local inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Run the supported CLI/config path in a temp directory with crafted local input; assert clean error, no state corruption, and bounded runtime.

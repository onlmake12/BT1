# Q2427: High rpc state transition mismatch in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an indexer/RPC client requesting adversarial ranges, filters, cursors, and pagination values and sequence block/template parameters, transaction payloads, fee-rate values, and debug/experiment options so `lib` in `util/rich-indexer/src/lib.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow amplify storage scans or proof generation with small crafted RPC requests, violating proof, filter, and index queries must remain bounded and not expose stale security-relevant data, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/rich-indexer/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: an indexer/RPC client requesting adversarial ranges, filters, cursors, and pagination values
- Attacker controls: block/template parameters, transaction payloads, fee-rate values, and debug/experiment options
- Exploit idea: amplify storage scans or proof generation with small crafted RPC requests
- Invariant to test: proof, filter, and index queries must remain bounded and not expose stale security-relevant data
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.

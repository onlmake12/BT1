# Q3866: Critical vm cross module inconsistency in InputField

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a malicious script spawning or execing child processes with adversarial inherited descriptors and pipes to make `InputField` in `script/src/syscalls/mod.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where trigger a VM panic or host-side bounds error before the transaction is rejected, violating cycle accounting and process state must remain bounded and cannot be bypassed by crafted scripts, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/syscalls/mod.rs::InputField`
- Entrypoint: a malicious script spawning or execing child processes with adversarial inherited descriptors and pipes
- Attacker controls: spawn/exec metadata, pipe/read/write order, inherited fds, process IDs, and wait/close timing
- Exploit idea: trigger a VM panic or host-side bounds error before the transaction is rejected
- Invariant to test: cycle accounting and process state must remain bounded and cannot be bypassed by crafted scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

# Q121: Low cli limit off by one in cli

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for TOML config values, resource templates, default directories, sentry/log/metrics settings, and process state through an operator-facing component processing log, metrics, memory, runtime, or launcher state so `cli` in `util/app-config/src/cli.rs` cause important performance degradation in a default-enabled operator path with small local input, violating operator-facing services must not crash or degrade the node through valid local inputs, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `util/app-config/src/cli.rs::cli`
- Entrypoint: an operator-facing component processing log, metrics, memory, runtime, or launcher state
- Attacker controls: TOML config values, resource templates, default directories, sentry/log/metrics settings, and process state
- Exploit idea: cause important performance degradation in a default-enabled operator path with small local input
- Invariant to test: operator-facing services must not crash or degrade the node through valid local inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Run the supported CLI/config path in a temp directory with crafted local input; assert clean error, no state corruption, and bounded runtime.

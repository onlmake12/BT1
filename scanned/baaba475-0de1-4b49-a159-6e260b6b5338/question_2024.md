# Q2024: Critical network cross module inconsistency in new

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads to make `new` in `sync/src/synchronizer/headers_process.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload, violating P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/synchronizer/headers_process.rs::new`
- Entrypoint: a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads
- Attacker controls: peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing
- Exploit idea: trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload
- Invariant to test: P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

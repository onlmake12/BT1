# Q2518: High storage batch interaction bug in get_pinned

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch database column contents derived from accepted blocks, freezer boundaries, migration versions, and write-batch size through a sync peer causing repeated rollback, truncation, migration, or state lookup edge cases so `get_pinned` in `db/src/snapshot.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and force large storage or lookup amplification with a small number of valid blocks or transactions, violating state storage mechanisms must not allow cheap corruption, excessive growth, or crash-on-restart, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `db/src/snapshot.rs::get_pinned`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer causing repeated rollback, truncation, migration, or state lookup edge cases
- Attacker controls: database column contents derived from accepted blocks, freezer boundaries, migration versions, and write-batch size
- Exploit idea: force large storage or lookup amplification with a small number of valid blocks or transactions
- Invariant to test: state storage mechanisms must not allow cheap corruption, excessive growth, or crash-on-restart
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

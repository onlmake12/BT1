# Q3629: Critical txpool canonical encoding ambiguity in Error

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for transaction fee, size, cycles, deps, ancestor/descendant graph, orphan parents, and proposal status through a transaction sender repeatedly submitting package, orphan, replacement, and low-fee transactions so `Error` in `util/fee-estimator/src/error.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and make block assembly include invalid, duplicate, or economically wrong transactions or rewards, violating valid user transactions must not be persistently censored by cheap attacker-created pool state, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `util/fee-estimator/src/error.rs::Error`
- Entrypoint: a transaction sender repeatedly submitting package, orphan, replacement, and low-fee transactions
- Attacker controls: transaction fee, size, cycles, deps, ancestor/descendant graph, orphan parents, and proposal status
- Exploit idea: make block assembly include invalid, duplicate, or economically wrong transactions or rewards
- Invariant to test: valid user transactions must not be persistently censored by cheap attacker-created pool state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Simulate tx-pool submission, orphan/recent-reject transitions, and block-template assembly; assert bounded queues and consensus-valid output.

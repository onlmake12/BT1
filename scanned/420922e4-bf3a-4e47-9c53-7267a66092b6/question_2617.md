# Q2617: High storage differential path split in len

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `len` in `shared/src/types/header_map/backend.rs` through two production paths from a peer-driven chain/reorg sequence that writes adversarial canonical and fork state and make one path accept while the other rejects because of index keys, number-hash mappings, cell status transitions, and restart timing, violating persisted CKB state must remain canonical, recoverable, and internally consistent across reorg/restart, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `shared/src/types/header_map/backend.rs::len`
- Entrypoint: a peer-driven chain/reorg sequence that writes adversarial canonical and fork state
- Attacker controls: index keys, number-hash mappings, cell status transitions, and restart timing
- Exploit idea: make persisted state disagree with canonical verification state after restart or rollback
- Invariant to test: persisted CKB state must remain canonical, recoverable, and internally consistent across reorg/restart
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

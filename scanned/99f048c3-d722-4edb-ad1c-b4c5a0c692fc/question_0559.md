# Q559: High consensus limit off by one in from

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for genesis/spec fields on a private chain and canonical block metadata during replay through a remote peer relaying a crafted block/header sequence so `from` in `spec/src/versionbits/convert.rs` trigger an arithmetic, encoding, or target-conversion edge before the normal consensus rejection path, violating malformed consensus objects must return structured errors without node panic or unbounded work, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `spec/src/versionbits/convert.rs::from`
- Entrypoint: a remote peer relaying a crafted block/header sequence
- Attacker controls: genesis/spec fields on a private chain and canonical block metadata during replay
- Exploit idea: trigger an arithmetic, encoding, or target-conversion edge before the normal consensus rejection path
- Invariant to test: malformed consensus objects must return structured errors without node panic or unbounded work
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

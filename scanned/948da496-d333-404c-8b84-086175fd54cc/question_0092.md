# Q92: High cli resource amplification in build

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small local database contents, malformed config files, and supported operator commands through a local command-line user invoking supported CKB subcommands with crafted arguments to make `build` in `ckb-bin/src/subcommand/stats.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and cause important performance degradation in a default-enabled operator path with small local input, violating default-enabled configuration must preserve security, performance, and protocol assumptions, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `ckb-bin/src/subcommand/stats.rs::build`
- Entrypoint: a local command-line user invoking supported CKB subcommands with crafted arguments
- Attacker controls: local database contents, malformed config files, and supported operator commands
- Exploit idea: cause important performance degradation in a default-enabled operator path with small local input
- Invariant to test: default-enabled configuration must preserve security, performance, and protocol assumptions
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Run the supported CLI/config path in a temp directory with crafted local input; assert clean error, no state corruption, and bounded runtime.

# Q2830: Medium storage restart reorg persistence in migrations

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape index keys, number-hash mappings, cell status transitions, and restart timing through a sync peer causing repeated rollback, truncation, migration, or state lookup edge cases, then force normal restart, reorg, retry, or replay handling so `migrations` in `util/migrate/src/migrations/mod.rs` persists inconsistent state and lose, duplicate, or stale-cache cells/headers across snapshots and write batches, violating database writes, freezer state, migrations, and snapshots must be atomic for security-relevant data, causing Medium (2001 - 10000 points). Suboptimal implementation of CKB state storage mechanism?

## Target
- File/function: `util/migrate/src/migrations/mod.rs::migrations`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer causing repeated rollback, truncation, migration, or state lookup edge cases
- Attacker controls: index keys, number-hash mappings, cell status transitions, and restart timing
- Exploit idea: lose, duplicate, or stale-cache cells/headers across snapshots and write batches
- Invariant to test: database writes, freezer state, migrations, and snapshots must be atomic for security-relevant data
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium (2001 - 10000 points). Suboptimal implementation of CKB state storage mechanism
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

# Q1975: High network differential path split in with_context

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `with_context` in `sync/src/status.rs` through two production paths from a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages and make one path accept while the other rejects because of compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs, violating malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/status.rs::with_context`
- Entrypoint: a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages
- Attacker controls: compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs
- Exploit idea: trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload
- Invariant to test: malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

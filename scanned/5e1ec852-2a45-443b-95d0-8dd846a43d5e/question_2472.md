# Q2472: Critical storage limit off by one in create_cf_with_ttl

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for block order, reorg depth, cell lifetimes, transaction metadata, header maps, and snapshot timing through a peer-driven chain/reorg sequence that writes adversarial canonical and fork state so `create_cf_with_ttl` in `db/src/db_with_ttl.rs` trigger database/freezer/migration panic or unrecoverable state from attacker-shaped accepted data, violating cell/header/transaction metadata must match the verified chain and never expose stale spendability, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `db/src/db_with_ttl.rs::create_cf_with_ttl`
- Entrypoint: a peer-driven chain/reorg sequence that writes adversarial canonical and fork state
- Attacker controls: block order, reorg depth, cell lifetimes, transaction metadata, header maps, and snapshot timing
- Exploit idea: trigger database/freezer/migration panic or unrecoverable state from attacker-shaped accepted data
- Invariant to test: cell/header/transaction metadata must match the verified chain and never expose stale spendability
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

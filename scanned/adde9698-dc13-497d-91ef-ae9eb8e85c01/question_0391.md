# Q391: Critical consensus batch interaction bug in GlobalIndex

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch uncle lists, proposal IDs, block extension bytes, transaction roots, and DAO fields through an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects so `GlobalIndex` in `chain/src/lib.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and force two verification paths to classify the same block differently around a boundary check, violating all honest nodes must deterministically accept and reject the same blocks under the same consensus spec, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/src/lib.rs::GlobalIndex`
- Entrypoint: an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects
- Attacker controls: uncle lists, proposal IDs, block extension bytes, transaction roots, and DAO fields
- Exploit idea: force two verification paths to classify the same block differently around a boundary check
- Invariant to test: all honest nodes must deterministically accept and reject the same blocks under the same consensus spec
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

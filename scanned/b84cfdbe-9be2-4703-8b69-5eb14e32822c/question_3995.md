# Q3995: High vm cross module inconsistency in epoch_number

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a malicious script spawning or execing child processes with adversarial inherited descriptors and pipes to make `epoch_number` in `script/src/verify_env.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make VM version gating select the wrong behavior at a hardfork boundary, violating scripts must see exactly the resolved cells, headers, witnesses, and block extensions committed by consensus, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/verify_env.rs::epoch_number`
- Entrypoint: a malicious script spawning or execing child processes with adversarial inherited descriptors and pipes
- Attacker controls: cycle limits, VM version, script hash type, loaded cell/header/tx/block-extension data
- Exploit idea: make VM version gating select the wrong behavior at a hardfork boundary
- Invariant to test: scripts must see exactly the resolved cells, headers, witnesses, and block extensions committed by consensus
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

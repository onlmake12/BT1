# Q667: Critical consensus state transition mismatch in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a sync peer delivering reordered headers, uncles, and block extensions and sequence genesis/spec fields on a private chain and canonical block metadata during replay so `lib` in `verification/src/lib.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow make fork-choice or delayed verification commit a block whose derived roots or epoch data disagree with recalculation, violating fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `verification/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering reordered headers, uncles, and block extensions
- Attacker controls: genesis/spec fields on a private chain and canonical block metadata during replay
- Exploit idea: make fork-choice or delayed verification commit a block whose derived roots or epoch data disagree with recalculation
- Invariant to test: fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

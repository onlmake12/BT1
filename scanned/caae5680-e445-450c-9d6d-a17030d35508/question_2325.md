# Q2325: Low rpc cross module inconsistency in epoch_number

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters to make `epoch_number` in `util/jsonrpc-types/src/primitive.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where return stale or inconsistent security-relevant state after reorg, restart, or concurrent indexing, violating proof, filter, and index queries must remain bounded and not expose stale security-relevant data, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `util/jsonrpc-types/src/primitive.rs::epoch_number`
- Entrypoint: a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters
- Attacker controls: indexer state freshness, reorg timing, block-filter requests, and proof target positions
- Exploit idea: return stale or inconsistent security-relevant state after reorg, restart, or concurrent indexing
- Invariant to test: proof, filter, and index queries must remain bounded and not expose stale security-relevant data
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.

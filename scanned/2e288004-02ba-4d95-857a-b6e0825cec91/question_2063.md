# Q2063: High network limit off by one in send_message

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths through a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks so `send_message` in `sync/src/utils.rs` desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply, violating peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/utils.rs::send_message`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks
- Attacker controls: message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths
- Exploit idea: desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply
- Invariant to test: peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

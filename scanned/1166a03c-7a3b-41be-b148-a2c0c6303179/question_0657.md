# Q657: High consensus canonical encoding ambiguity in Verifier

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for fork order, orphan arrival timing, hardfork activation boundary, and reorg depth through a remote peer relaying a crafted block/header sequence so `Verifier` in `verification/src/header_verifier.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and trigger an arithmetic, encoding, or target-conversion edge before the normal consensus rejection path, violating fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `verification/src/header_verifier.rs::Verifier`
- Entrypoint: a remote peer relaying a crafted block/header sequence
- Attacker controls: fork order, orphan arrival timing, hardfork activation boundary, and reorg depth
- Exploit idea: trigger an arithmetic, encoding, or target-conversion edge before the normal consensus rejection path
- Invariant to test: fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

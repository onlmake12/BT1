# Q954: Low core limit off by one in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs through a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates so `lib` in `util/gen-types/src/lib.rs` make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers, violating shared production helpers must be deterministic, bounded, and canonical for all security-relevant callers, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `util/gen-types/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates
- Attacker controls: message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs
- Exploit idea: make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers
- Invariant to test: shared production helpers must be deterministic, bounded, and canonical for all security-relevant callers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

# Q2785: High storage canonical encoding ambiguity in expensive

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for index keys, number-hash mappings, cell status transitions, and restart timing through a node receiving valid-looking blocks that stress snapshots, caches, freezer, and write batches so `expensive` in `util/migrate/src/migrations/add_block_filter_hash.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and force large storage or lookup amplification with a small number of valid blocks or transactions, violating cell/header/transaction metadata must match the verified chain and never expose stale spendability, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/migrate/src/migrations/add_block_filter_hash.rs::expensive`
- Entrypoint: a node receiving valid-looking blocks that stress snapshots, caches, freezer, and write batches
- Attacker controls: index keys, number-hash mappings, cell status transitions, and restart timing
- Exploit idea: force large storage or lookup amplification with a small number of valid blocks or transactions
- Invariant to test: cell/header/transaction metadata must match the verified chain and never expose stale spendability
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

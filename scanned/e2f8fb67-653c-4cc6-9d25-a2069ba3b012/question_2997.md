# Q2997: Critical transaction limit off by one in get_block_extension

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for cell deps, header deps, witnesses, lock/type args, output data lengths, and capacity values through a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block so `get_block_extension` in `traits/src/extension_provider.rs` create a state transition where capacity or spendability changes without a matching valid authorization, violating transactions cannot spend cells without satisfying lock/type script authorization, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `traits/src/extension_provider.rs::get_block_extension`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block
- Attacker controls: cell deps, header deps, witnesses, lock/type args, output data lengths, and capacity values
- Exploit idea: create a state transition where capacity or spendability changes without a matching valid authorization
- Invariant to test: transactions cannot spend cells without satisfying lock/type script authorization
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

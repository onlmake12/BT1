# Q3807: High vm batch interaction bug in resolved_cell_deps

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch cycle limits, VM version, script hash type, loaded cell/header/tx/block-extension data through a block relayer executing transactions at VM-version or hardfork activation boundaries so `resolved_cell_deps` in `script/src/syscalls/load_header.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and make VM version gating select the wrong behavior at a hardfork boundary, violating cycle accounting and process state must remain bounded and cannot be bypassed by crafted scripts, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/syscalls/load_header.rs::resolved_cell_deps`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer executing transactions at VM-version or hardfork activation boundaries
- Attacker controls: cycle limits, VM version, script hash type, loaded cell/header/tx/block-extension data
- Exploit idea: make VM version gating select the wrong behavior at a hardfork boundary
- Invariant to test: cycle accounting and process state must remain bounded and cannot be bypassed by crafted scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

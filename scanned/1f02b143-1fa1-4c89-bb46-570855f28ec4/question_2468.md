# Q2468: Critical storage cache invalidation failure in inner

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a sync peer causing repeated rollback, truncation, migration, or state lookup edge cases to alternate valid and invalid cache pressure, rollback order, canonical/forked block alternation, and missing extension/filter data so `inner` in `db/src/db.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and force large storage or lookup amplification with a small number of valid blocks or transactions, violating cell/header/transaction metadata must match the verified chain and never expose stale spendability, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `db/src/db.rs::inner`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer causing repeated rollback, truncation, migration, or state lookup edge cases
- Attacker controls: cache pressure, rollback order, canonical/forked block alternation, and missing extension/filter data
- Exploit idea: force large storage or lookup amplification with a small number of valid blocks or transactions
- Invariant to test: cell/header/transaction metadata must match the verified chain and never expose stale spendability
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

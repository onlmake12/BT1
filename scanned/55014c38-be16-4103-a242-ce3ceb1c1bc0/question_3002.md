# Q3002: High transaction cross module inconsistency in HeaderFields

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a tx-pool submitter racing mempool admission against chain reorg or cell status changes to make `HeaderFields` in `traits/src/header_provider.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization, violating capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `traits/src/header_provider.rs::HeaderFields`
- Entrypoint: a tx-pool submitter racing mempool admission against chain reorg or cell status changes
- Attacker controls: canonical cell status before and after reorg, snapshot lookup results, and dep-group layout
- Exploit idea: bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization
- Invariant to test: capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

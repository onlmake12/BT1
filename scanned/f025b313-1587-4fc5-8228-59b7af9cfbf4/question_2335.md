# Q2335: High rpc batch interaction bug in LogLevel

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch indexer state freshness, reorg timing, block-filter requests, and proof target positions through a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters so `LogLevel` in `util/jsonrpc-types/src/subscription.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and make RPC/indexer code panic or allocate heavily before validation clamps the request, violating RPC/indexer/helper state must match canonical chain state after reorg, restart, and pagination, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/jsonrpc-types/src/subscription.rs::LogLevel`
- Entrypoint: a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters
- Attacker controls: indexer state freshness, reorg timing, block-filter requests, and proof target positions
- Exploit idea: make RPC/indexer code panic or allocate heavily before validation clamps the request
- Invariant to test: RPC/indexer/helper state must match canonical chain state after reorg, restart, and pagination
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.

# Q3119: Critical transaction cross module inconsistency in capacity_bytes

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a transaction sender submitting crafted inputs, outputs, deps, witnesses, and since values to make `capacity_bytes` in `util/occupied-capacity/macros/src/lib.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where create a state transition where capacity or spendability changes without a matching valid authorization, violating resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `util/occupied-capacity/macros/src/lib.rs::capacity_bytes`
- Entrypoint: a transaction sender submitting crafted inputs, outputs, deps, witnesses, and since values
- Attacker controls: input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries
- Exploit idea: create a state transition where capacity or spendability changes without a matching valid authorization
- Invariant to test: resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

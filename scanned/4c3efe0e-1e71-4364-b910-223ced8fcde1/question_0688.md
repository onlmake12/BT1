# Q688: Critical consensus cross module inconsistency in disable_uncles

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a miner on a private chain producing valid-PoW boundary blocks to make `disable_uncles` in `verification/traits/src/lib.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where force two verification paths to classify the same block differently around a boundary check, violating invalid PoW, epoch, uncle, proposal, extension, DAO, or root data must never become canonical, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `verification/traits/src/lib.rs::disable_uncles`
- Entrypoint: a miner on a private chain producing valid-PoW boundary blocks
- Attacker controls: fork order, orphan arrival timing, hardfork activation boundary, and reorg depth
- Exploit idea: force two verification paths to classify the same block differently around a boundary check
- Invariant to test: invalid PoW, epoch, uncle, proposal, extension, DAO, or root data must never become canonical
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

# Q1244: Critical crypto batch interaction bug in H520

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch network-alert payload bytes, serialization format, byte order, and fixed-hash lengths through a block relayer supplying Merkle/MMR/proof-related data at boundary lengths so `H520` in `util/fixed-hash/core/src/lib.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and panic or overrun a cryptographic parser before a malformed object is rejected, violating hash, Merkle, MMR, and fixed-byte conversions must be canonical across consensus and RPC paths, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `util/fixed-hash/core/src/lib.rs::H520`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer supplying Merkle/MMR/proof-related data at boundary lengths
- Attacker controls: network-alert payload bytes, serialization format, byte order, and fixed-hash lengths
- Exploit idea: panic or overrun a cryptographic parser before a malformed object is rejected
- Invariant to test: hash, Merkle, MMR, and fixed-byte conversions must be canonical across consensus and RPC paths
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Add a property or unit test over signatures, hashes, proofs, and encodings; assert malformed variants reject without panic.

# Q3959: High vm canonical encoding ambiguity in new

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for RISC-V bytecode, argv/env, witness bytes, syscall offsets, lengths, indexes, and source selectors through a malicious script spawning or execing child processes with adversarial inherited descriptors and pipes so `new` in `script/src/syscalls/write.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and trigger a VM panic or host-side bounds error before the transaction is rejected, violating malformed syscall arguments must fail safely without node crash or authorization bypass, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/syscalls/write.rs::new`
- Entrypoint: a malicious script spawning or execing child processes with adversarial inherited descriptors and pipes
- Attacker controls: RISC-V bytecode, argv/env, witness bytes, syscall offsets, lengths, indexes, and source selectors
- Exploit idea: trigger a VM panic or host-side bounds error before the transaction is rejected
- Invariant to test: malformed syscall arguments must fail safely without node crash or authorization bypass
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

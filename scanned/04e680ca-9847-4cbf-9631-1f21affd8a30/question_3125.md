# Q3125: High transaction batch interaction bug in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch maturity height, since flags, DAO fields, resolved transaction data, and duplicate dependencies through a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block so `lib` in `util/occupied-capacity/src/lib.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and create a state transition where capacity or spendability changes without a matching valid authorization, violating capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `util/occupied-capacity/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block
- Attacker controls: maturity height, since flags, DAO fields, resolved transaction data, and duplicate dependencies
- Exploit idea: create a state transition where capacity or spendability changes without a matching valid authorization
- Invariant to test: capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

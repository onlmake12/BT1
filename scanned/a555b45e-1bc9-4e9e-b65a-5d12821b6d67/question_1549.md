# Q1549: High network limit off by one in fmt

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths through a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks so `fmt` in `network/src/peer_store/browser.rs` cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied, violating malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/peer_store/browser.rs::fmt`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks
- Attacker controls: message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths
- Exploit idea: cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied
- Invariant to test: malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

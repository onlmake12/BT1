# Q1478: High network resource amplification in can_dial

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs through a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records to make `can_dial` in `network/src/network.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload, violating P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/network.rs::can_dial`
- Entrypoint: a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records
- Attacker controls: compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs
- Exploit idea: trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload
- Invariant to test: P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

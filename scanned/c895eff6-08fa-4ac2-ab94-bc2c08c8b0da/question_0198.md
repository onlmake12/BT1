# Q198: Low cli limit off by one in default_max_tx_verify_workers

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for CLI flags, file paths, chain spec choice, import/export ranges, replay targets, and migration options through an operator-facing component processing log, metrics, memory, runtime, or launcher state so `default_max_tx_verify_workers` in `util/app-config/src/configs/tx_pool.rs` trigger an import/export/replay/migrate path to disagree with normal node validation or storage state, violating default-enabled configuration must preserve security, performance, and protocol assumptions, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `util/app-config/src/configs/tx_pool.rs::default_max_tx_verify_workers`
- Entrypoint: an operator-facing component processing log, metrics, memory, runtime, or launcher state
- Attacker controls: CLI flags, file paths, chain spec choice, import/export ranges, replay targets, and migration options
- Exploit idea: trigger an import/export/replay/migrate path to disagree with normal node validation or storage state
- Invariant to test: default-enabled configuration must preserve security, performance, and protocol assumptions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Run the supported CLI/config path in a temp directory with crafted local input; assert clean error, no state corruption, and bounded runtime.

# Q1388: Critical crypto limit off by one in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for script args, witness lock fields, pubkey hash matching, and conversion boundaries through a script author relying on secp/multisig/hash utilities through system script behavior so `lib` in `util/network-alert/src/lib.rs` panic or overrun a cryptographic parser before a malformed object is rejected, violating malformed signatures, proofs, alerts, or hashes must never crash a node or bypass authorization, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `util/network-alert/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a script author relying on secp/multisig/hash utilities through system script behavior
- Attacker controls: script args, witness lock fields, pubkey hash matching, and conversion boundaries
- Exploit idea: panic or overrun a cryptographic parser before a malformed object is rejected
- Invariant to test: malformed signatures, proofs, alerts, or hashes must never crash a node or bypass authorization
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Add a property or unit test over signatures, hashes, proofs, and encodings; assert malformed variants reject without panic.

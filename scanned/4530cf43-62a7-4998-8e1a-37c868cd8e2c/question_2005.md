# Q2005: High network parser precheck gap in new

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit malformed-but-reachable peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing through a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks so `new` in `sync/src/synchronizer/get_blocks_process.rs` performs expensive or unsafe work before validation and desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply, violating P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/synchronizer/get_blocks_process.rs::new`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks
- Attacker controls: peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing
- Exploit idea: desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply
- Invariant to test: P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

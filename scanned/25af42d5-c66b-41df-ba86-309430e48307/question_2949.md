# Q2949: High transaction limit off by one in new

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries through a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block so `new` in `sync/src/relayer/get_transactions_process.rs` make dependency resolution use a different cell/header than the script-visible authorization path, violating transactions cannot spend cells without satisfying lock/type script authorization, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/relayer/get_transactions_process.rs::new`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block
- Attacker controls: input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries
- Exploit idea: make dependency resolution use a different cell/header than the script-visible authorization path
- Invariant to test: transactions cannot spend cells without satisfying lock/type script authorization
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

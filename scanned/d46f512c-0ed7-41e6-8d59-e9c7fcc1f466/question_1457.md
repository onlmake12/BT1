# Q1457: High network differential path split in Error

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Error` in `network/src/errors.rs` through two production paths from a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks and make one path accept while the other rejects because of message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths, violating malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/errors.rs::Error`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks
- Attacker controls: message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths
- Exploit idea: cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied
- Invariant to test: malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

# Q1935: High network restart reorg persistence in non_contextual_check

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses through a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks, then force normal restart, reorg, retry, or replay handling so `non_contextual_check` in `sync/src/relayer/compact_block_process.rs` persists inconsistent state and desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply, violating peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/relayer/compact_block_process.rs::non_contextual_check`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks
- Attacker controls: header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses
- Exploit idea: desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply
- Invariant to test: peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

# Q2712: High storage batch interaction bug in ChainStore

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch database column contents derived from accepted blocks, freezer boundaries, migration versions, and write-batch size through a node receiving valid-looking blocks that stress snapshots, caches, freezer, and write batches so `ChainStore` in `store/src/snapshot.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and trigger database/freezer/migration panic or unrecoverable state from attacker-shaped accepted data, violating database writes, freezer state, migrations, and snapshots must be atomic for security-relevant data, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `store/src/snapshot.rs::ChainStore`
- Entrypoint: a node receiving valid-looking blocks that stress snapshots, caches, freezer, and write batches
- Attacker controls: database column contents derived from accepted blocks, freezer boundaries, migration versions, and write-batch size
- Exploit idea: trigger database/freezer/migration panic or unrecoverable state from attacker-shaped accepted data
- Invariant to test: database writes, freezer state, migrations, and snapshots must be atomic for security-relevant data
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

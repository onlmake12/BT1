# Q617: Critical consensus differential path split in from

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `from` in `verification/src/cache.rs` through two production paths from a miner on a private chain producing valid-PoW boundary blocks and make one path accept while the other rejects because of fork order, orphan arrival timing, hardfork activation boundary, and reorg depth, violating malformed consensus objects must return structured errors without node panic or unbounded work, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `verification/src/cache.rs::from`
- Entrypoint: a miner on a private chain producing valid-PoW boundary blocks
- Attacker controls: fork order, orphan arrival timing, hardfork activation boundary, and reorg depth
- Exploit idea: make fork-choice or delayed verification commit a block whose derived roots or epoch data disagree with recalculation
- Invariant to test: malformed consensus objects must return structured errors without node panic or unbounded work
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

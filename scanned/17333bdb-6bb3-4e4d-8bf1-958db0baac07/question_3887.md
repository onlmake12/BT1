# Q3887: High vm cache invalidation failure in initialize

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a block relayer executing transactions at VM-version or hardfork activation boundaries to alternate valid and invalid malformed buffers, return codes, memory pointers, and script group composition so `initialize` in `script/src/syscalls/pipe.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and trigger a VM panic or host-side bounds error before the transaction is rejected, violating CKB-VM and syscall behavior must be deterministic and consensus-equivalent across nodes, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/syscalls/pipe.rs::initialize`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer executing transactions at VM-version or hardfork activation boundaries
- Attacker controls: malformed buffers, return codes, memory pointers, and script group composition
- Exploit idea: trigger a VM panic or host-side bounds error before the transaction is rejected
- Invariant to test: CKB-VM and syscall behavior must be deterministic and consensus-equivalent across nodes
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

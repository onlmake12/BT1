# Q3695: High vm resource amplification in source

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small malformed buffers, return codes, memory pointers, and script group composition through a script author invoking syscalls with boundary offsets, lengths, file descriptors, and process handles to make `source` in `script/src/error.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and make VM version gating select the wrong behavior at a hardfork boundary, violating CKB-VM and syscall behavior must be deterministic and consensus-equivalent across nodes, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/error.rs::source`
- Entrypoint: a script author invoking syscalls with boundary offsets, lengths, file descriptors, and process handles
- Attacker controls: malformed buffers, return codes, memory pointers, and script group composition
- Exploit idea: make VM version gating select the wrong behavior at a hardfork boundary
- Invariant to test: CKB-VM and syscall behavior must be deterministic and consensus-equivalent across nodes
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

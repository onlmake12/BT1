# Q97: High cli restart reorg persistence in fmt

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape local database contents, malformed config files, and supported operator commands through a local command-line user invoking supported CKB subcommands with crafted arguments, then force normal restart, reorg, retry, or replay handling so `fmt` in `resource/src/lib.rs` persists inconsistent state and trigger an import/export/replay/migrate path to disagree with normal node validation or storage state, violating import/export/replay/migration behavior must match production validation and storage invariants, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `resource/src/lib.rs::fmt`
- Entrypoint: a local command-line user invoking supported CKB subcommands with crafted arguments
- Attacker controls: local database contents, malformed config files, and supported operator commands
- Exploit idea: trigger an import/export/replay/migrate path to disagree with normal node validation or storage state
- Invariant to test: import/export/replay/migration behavior must match production validation and storage invariants
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Run the supported CLI/config path in a temp directory with crafted local input; assert clean error, no state corruption, and bounded runtime.

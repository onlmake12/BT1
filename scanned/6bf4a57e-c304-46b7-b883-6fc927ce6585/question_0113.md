# Q113: High cli cross module inconsistency in memory_tracker

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use an operator-facing component processing log, metrics, memory, runtime, or launcher state to make `memory_tracker` in `util/app-config/src/app_config.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where cause important performance degradation in a default-enabled operator path with small local input, violating supported local CLI and config paths must fail cleanly and not corrupt node state, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/app-config/src/app_config.rs::memory_tracker`
- Entrypoint: an operator-facing component processing log, metrics, memory, runtime, or launcher state
- Attacker controls: runtime stop timing, spawned process handles, channel pressure, memory tracker samples, and data paths
- Exploit idea: cause important performance degradation in a default-enabled operator path with small local input
- Invariant to test: supported local CLI and config paths must fail cleanly and not corrupt node state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Run the supported CLI/config path in a temp directory with crafted local input; assert clean error, no state corruption, and bounded runtime.

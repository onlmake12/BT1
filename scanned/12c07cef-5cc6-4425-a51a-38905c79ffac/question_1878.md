# Q1878: Critical network canonical encoding ambiguity in BlockFilter

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses through a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records so `BlockFilter` in `sync/src/filter/mod.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload, violating malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/filter/mod.rs::BlockFilter`
- Entrypoint: a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records
- Attacker controls: header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses
- Exploit idea: trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload
- Invariant to test: malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

# Q3339: Critical txpool state transition mismatch in request

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a local miner process selecting proposals and uncles near limit boundaries and sequence verify-queue ordering, recent-reject keys, pool capacity pressure, and reorg timing so `request` in `miner/src/client.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow make tx-pool policy accept a transaction that block verification later rejects, or reject valid traffic cheaply, violating valid user transactions must not be persistently censored by cheap attacker-created pool state, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `miner/src/client.rs::request`
- Entrypoint: a local miner process selecting proposals and uncles near limit boundaries
- Attacker controls: verify-queue ordering, recent-reject keys, pool capacity pressure, and reorg timing
- Exploit idea: make tx-pool policy accept a transaction that block verification later rejects, or reject valid traffic cheaply
- Invariant to test: valid user transactions must not be persistently censored by cheap attacker-created pool state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Simulate tx-pool submission, orphan/recent-reject transitions, and block-template assembly; assert bounded queues and consensus-valid output.

# Q3533: Critical txpool canonical encoding ambiguity in BlockAssemblerError

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for duplicate hashes, conflicted inputs, dep-heavy packages, and repeated rejected submissions through a peer relaying transactions that race recent-reject, orphan, and verification-queue state so `BlockAssemblerError` in `tx-pool/src/error.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and make tx-pool policy accept a transaction that block verification later rejects, or reject valid traffic cheaply, violating pool, orphan, recent-reject, and verify-queue resource use must stay bounded under attacker submissions, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `tx-pool/src/error.rs::BlockAssemblerError`
- Entrypoint: a peer relaying transactions that race recent-reject, orphan, and verification-queue state
- Attacker controls: duplicate hashes, conflicted inputs, dep-heavy packages, and repeated rejected submissions
- Exploit idea: make tx-pool policy accept a transaction that block verification later rejects, or reject valid traffic cheaply
- Invariant to test: pool, orphan, recent-reject, and verify-queue resource use must stay bounded under attacker submissions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Simulate tx-pool submission, orphan/recent-reject transitions, and block-template assembly; assert bounded queues and consensus-valid output.

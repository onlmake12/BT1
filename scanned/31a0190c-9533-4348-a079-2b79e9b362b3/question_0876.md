# Q876: High core canonical encoding ambiguity in BytesReader

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior through an unprivileged peer, RPC caller, or transaction sender reaching this shared module through production paths so `BytesReader` in `util/gen-types/src/conversion/primitive.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and make canonical serialization or conversion accept an ambiguous representation, violating security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/gen-types/src/conversion/primitive.rs::BytesReader`
- Entrypoint: an unprivileged peer, RPC caller, or transaction sender reaching this shared module through production paths
- Attacker controls: local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior
- Exploit idea: make canonical serialization or conversion accept an ambiguous representation
- Invariant to test: security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

# Q1846: High network resource amplification in GetBlockFilterCheckPointsProcess

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing through a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records to make `GetBlockFilterCheckPointsProcess` in `sync/src/filter/get_block_filter_check_points_process.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied, violating peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/filter/get_block_filter_check_points_process.rs::GetBlockFilterCheckPointsProcess`
- Entrypoint: a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records
- Attacker controls: peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing
- Exploit idea: cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied
- Invariant to test: peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

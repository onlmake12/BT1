# Q2246: High rpc differential path split in TransactionTemplate

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `TransactionTemplate` in `util/jsonrpc-types/src/block_template.rs` through two production paths from a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters and make one path accept while the other rejects because of indexer state freshness, reorg timing, block-filter requests, and proof target positions, violating proof, filter, and index queries must remain bounded and not expose stale security-relevant data, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/jsonrpc-types/src/block_template.rs::TransactionTemplate`
- Entrypoint: a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters
- Attacker controls: indexer state freshness, reorg timing, block-filter requests, and proof target positions
- Exploit idea: cause locally submitted blocks/transactions to enter a path with weaker validation than P2P relay
- Invariant to test: proof, filter, and index queries must remain bounded and not expose stale security-relevant data
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.

# Q2900: Critical transaction cache invalidation failure in detach_block_cell

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block to alternate valid and invalid canonical cell status before and after reorg, snapshot lookup results, and dep-group layout so `detach_block_cell` in `store/src/cell.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and make non-contextual, contextual, and tx-pool verification disagree about the same transaction, violating capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `store/src/cell.rs::detach_block_cell`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block
- Attacker controls: canonical cell status before and after reorg, snapshot lookup results, and dep-group layout
- Exploit idea: make non-contextual, contextual, and tx-pool verification disagree about the same transaction
- Invariant to test: capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

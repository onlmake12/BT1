# Q3867: Critical vm cross module inconsistency in InputField

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a transaction sender deploying a crafted CKB-VM script and witness payload to make `InputField` in `script/src/syscalls/mod.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make a syscall expose bytes that differ from consensus-resolved transaction data, violating scripts must see exactly the resolved cells, headers, witnesses, and block extensions committed by consensus, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/syscalls/mod.rs::InputField`
- Entrypoint: a transaction sender deploying a crafted CKB-VM script and witness payload
- Attacker controls: RISC-V bytecode, argv/env, witness bytes, syscall offsets, lengths, indexes, and source selectors
- Exploit idea: make a syscall expose bytes that differ from consensus-resolved transaction data
- Invariant to test: scripts must see exactly the resolved cells, headers, witnesses, and block extensions committed by consensus
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

# Q1110: High core differential path split in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `lib` in `util/types/src/lib.rs` through two production paths from a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module and make one path accept while the other rejects because of local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior, violating caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module
- Attacker controls: local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior
- Exploit idea: trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input
- Invariant to test: caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

# Q460: High consensus cross module inconsistency in DummyPowEngine

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a miner on a private chain producing valid-PoW boundary blocks to make `DummyPowEngine` in `pow/src/dummy.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where force two verification paths to classify the same block differently around a boundary check, violating fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `pow/src/dummy.rs::DummyPowEngine`
- Entrypoint: a miner on a private chain producing valid-PoW boundary blocks
- Attacker controls: fork order, orphan arrival timing, hardfork activation boundary, and reorg depth
- Exploit idea: force two verification paths to classify the same block differently around a boundary check
- Invariant to test: fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

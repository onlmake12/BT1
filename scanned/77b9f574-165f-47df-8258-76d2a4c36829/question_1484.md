# Q1484: Critical network limit off by one in report_session

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs through a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads so `report_session` in `network/src/network.rs` make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse, violating sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/network.rs::report_session`
- Entrypoint: a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads
- Attacker controls: compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs
- Exploit idea: make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse
- Invariant to test: sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

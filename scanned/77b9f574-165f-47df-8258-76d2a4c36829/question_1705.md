# Q1705: Critical network batch interaction bug in received

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths through a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks so `received` in `network/src/protocols/hole_punching/mod.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply, violating malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/protocols/hole_punching/mod.rs::received`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks
- Attacker controls: message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths
- Exploit idea: desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply
- Invariant to test: malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

# Q2425: Low rpc limit off by one in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for RPC batch size, malformed hex/bytes, pagination direction, filter shape, and repeated polling cadence through a miner or wallet integration calling chain, pool, miner, net, debug, or subscription APIs so `lib` in `util/rich-indexer/src/lib.rs` amplify storage scans or proof generation with small crafted RPC requests, violating proof, filter, and index queries must remain bounded and not expose stale security-relevant data, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `util/rich-indexer/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a miner or wallet integration calling chain, pool, miner, net, debug, or subscription APIs
- Attacker controls: RPC batch size, malformed hex/bytes, pagination direction, filter shape, and repeated polling cadence
- Exploit idea: amplify storage scans or proof generation with small crafted RPC requests
- Invariant to test: proof, filter, and index queries must remain bounded and not expose stale security-relevant data
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.

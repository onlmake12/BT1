# Q1128: High core cross module inconsistency in calc_filter_hash

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates to make `calc_filter_hash` in `util/types/src/utilities/block_filter.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where break a resource bound or state transition that downstream modules assume is already enforced, violating security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/utilities/block_filter.rs::calc_filter_hash`
- Entrypoint: a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates
- Attacker controls: conversion inputs, collection lengths, duplicate identifiers, empty values, and maximum-size payloads
- Exploit idea: break a resource bound or state transition that downstream modules assume is already enforced
- Invariant to test: security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

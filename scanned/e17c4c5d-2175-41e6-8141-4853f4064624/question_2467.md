# Q2467: Medium storage limit off by one in get_snapshot

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for block order, reorg depth, cell lifetimes, transaction metadata, header maps, and snapshot timing through an operator replay/import/restart after attacker-shaped blocks, transactions, or indexes were persisted so `get_snapshot` in `db/src/db.rs` force large storage or lookup amplification with a small number of valid blocks or transactions, violating persisted CKB state must remain canonical, recoverable, and internally consistent across reorg/restart, causing Medium (2001 - 10000 points). Suboptimal implementation of CKB state storage mechanism?

## Target
- File/function: `db/src/db.rs::get_snapshot`
- Entrypoint: an operator replay/import/restart after attacker-shaped blocks, transactions, or indexes were persisted
- Attacker controls: block order, reorg depth, cell lifetimes, transaction metadata, header maps, and snapshot timing
- Exploit idea: force large storage or lookup amplification with a small number of valid blocks or transactions
- Invariant to test: persisted CKB state must remain canonical, recoverable, and internally consistent across reorg/restart
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium (2001 - 10000 points). Suboptimal implementation of CKB state storage mechanism
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

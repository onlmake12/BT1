# Q633: High consensus resource amplification in CommitError

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small uncle lists, proposal IDs, block extension bytes, transaction roots, and DAO fields through a remote peer relaying a crafted block/header sequence to make `CommitError` in `verification/src/error.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and trigger an arithmetic, encoding, or target-conversion edge before the normal consensus rejection path, violating all honest nodes must deterministically accept and reject the same blocks under the same consensus spec, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `verification/src/error.rs::CommitError`
- Entrypoint: a remote peer relaying a crafted block/header sequence
- Attacker controls: uncle lists, proposal IDs, block extension bytes, transaction roots, and DAO fields
- Exploit idea: trigger an arithmetic, encoding, or target-conversion edge before the normal consensus rejection path
- Invariant to test: all honest nodes must deterministically accept and reject the same blocks under the same consensus spec
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

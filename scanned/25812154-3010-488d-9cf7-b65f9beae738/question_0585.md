# Q585: Critical consensus cross module inconsistency in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a miner on a private chain producing valid-PoW boundary blocks to make `lib` in `verification/contextual/src/lib.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make fork-choice or delayed verification commit a block whose derived roots or epoch data disagree with recalculation, violating all honest nodes must deterministically accept and reject the same blocks under the same consensus spec, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `verification/contextual/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a miner on a private chain producing valid-PoW boundary blocks
- Attacker controls: uncle lists, proposal IDs, block extension bytes, transaction roots, and DAO fields
- Exploit idea: make fork-choice or delayed verification commit a block whose derived roots or epoch data disagree with recalculation
- Invariant to test: all honest nodes must deterministically accept and reject the same blocks under the same consensus spec
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

# Q2789: Critical storage cross module inconsistency in version

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a node receiving valid-looking blocks that stress snapshots, caches, freezer, and write batches to make `version` in `util/migrate/src/migrations/add_block_filter_hash.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make persisted state disagree with canonical verification state after restart or rollback, violating cell/header/transaction metadata must match the verified chain and never expose stale spendability, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `util/migrate/src/migrations/add_block_filter_hash.rs::version`
- Entrypoint: a node receiving valid-looking blocks that stress snapshots, caches, freezer, and write batches
- Attacker controls: database column contents derived from accepted blocks, freezer boundaries, migration versions, and write-batch size
- Exploit idea: make persisted state disagree with canonical verification state after restart or rollback
- Invariant to test: cell/header/transaction metadata must match the verified chain and never expose stale spendability
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

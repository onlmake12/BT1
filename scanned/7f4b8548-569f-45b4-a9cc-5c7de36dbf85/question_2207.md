# Q2207: Low rpc cross module inconsistency in SecondaryDB

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a miner or wallet integration calling chain, pool, miner, net, debug, or subscription APIs to make `SecondaryDB` in `util/indexer-sync/src/store.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make RPC/indexer code panic or allocate heavily before validation clamps the request, violating RPC/indexer/helper state must match canonical chain state after reorg, restart, and pagination, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `util/indexer-sync/src/store.rs::SecondaryDB`
- Entrypoint: a miner or wallet integration calling chain, pool, miner, net, debug, or subscription APIs
- Attacker controls: JSON numbers, hashes, block ranges, script/search keys, order flags, limits, cursors, and subscriptions
- Exploit idea: make RPC/indexer code panic or allocate heavily before validation clamps the request
- Invariant to test: RPC/indexer/helper state must match canonical chain state after reorg, restart, and pagination
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.

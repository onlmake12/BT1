# Q1799: High network parser precheck gap in Future

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit malformed-but-reachable peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing through a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records so `Future` in `network/src/services/dump_peer_store.rs` performs expensive or unsafe work before validation and make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse, violating peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/services/dump_peer_store.rs::Future`
- Entrypoint: a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records
- Attacker controls: peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing
- Exploit idea: make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse
- Invariant to test: peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

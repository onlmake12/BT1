# Q2226: High rpc cross module inconsistency in delete

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters to make `delete` in `util/indexer/src/store/mod.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where cause locally submitted blocks/transactions to enter a path with weaker validation than P2P relay, violating RPC/indexer/helper state must match canonical chain state after reorg, restart, and pagination, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/indexer/src/store/mod.rs::delete`
- Entrypoint: a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters
- Attacker controls: RPC batch size, malformed hex/bytes, pagination direction, filter shape, and repeated polling cadence
- Exploit idea: cause locally submitted blocks/transactions to enter a path with weaker validation than P2P relay
- Invariant to test: RPC/indexer/helper state must match canonical chain state after reorg, restart, and pagination
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.

# Q731: High core cross module inconsistency in fmt

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data to make `fmt` in `util/build-info/src/lib.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers, violating shared production helpers must be deterministic, bounded, and canonical for all security-relevant callers, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `util/build-info/src/lib.rs::fmt`
- Entrypoint: a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data
- Attacker controls: local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior
- Exploit idea: make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers
- Invariant to test: shared production helpers must be deterministic, bounded, and canonical for all security-relevant callers
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

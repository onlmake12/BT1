# Q1493: High network cache invalidation failure in from

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks to alternate valid and invalid peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing so `from` in `network/src/network_group.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied, violating peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/network_group.rs::from`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks
- Attacker controls: peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing
- Exploit idea: cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied
- Invariant to test: peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

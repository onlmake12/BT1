# Q3904: Critical vm limit off by one in ecall

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for spawn/exec metadata, pipe/read/write order, inherited fds, process IDs, and wait/close timing through a script author invoking syscalls with boundary offsets, lengths, file descriptors, and process handles so `ecall` in `script/src/syscalls/read.rs` make VM version gating select the wrong behavior at a hardfork boundary, violating malformed syscall arguments must fail safely without node crash or authorization bypass, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/syscalls/read.rs::ecall`
- Entrypoint: a script author invoking syscalls with boundary offsets, lengths, file descriptors, and process handles
- Attacker controls: spawn/exec metadata, pipe/read/write order, inherited fds, process IDs, and wait/close timing
- Exploit idea: make VM version gating select the wrong behavior at a hardfork boundary
- Invariant to test: malformed syscall arguments must fail safely without node crash or authorization bypass
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

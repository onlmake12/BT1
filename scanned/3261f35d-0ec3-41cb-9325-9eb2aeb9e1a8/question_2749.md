# Q2749: Medium storage cache invalidation failure in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a sync peer causing repeated rollback, truncation, migration, or state lookup edge cases to alternate valid and invalid cache pressure, rollback order, canonical/forked block alternation, and missing extension/filter data so `lib` in `util/migrate/src/lib.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and make persisted state disagree with canonical verification state after restart or rollback, violating state storage mechanisms must not allow cheap corruption, excessive growth, or crash-on-restart, causing Medium (2001 - 10000 points). Suboptimal implementation of CKB state storage mechanism?

## Target
- File/function: `util/migrate/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer causing repeated rollback, truncation, migration, or state lookup edge cases
- Attacker controls: cache pressure, rollback order, canonical/forked block alternation, and missing extension/filter data
- Exploit idea: make persisted state disagree with canonical verification state after restart or rollback
- Invariant to test: state storage mechanisms must not allow cheap corruption, excessive growth, or crash-on-restart
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium (2001 - 10000 points). Suboptimal implementation of CKB state storage mechanism
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

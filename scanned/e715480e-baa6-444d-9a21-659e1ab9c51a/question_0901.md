# Q901: High core cache invalidation failure in calc_header_hash

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates to alternate valid and invalid local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior so `calc_header_hash` in `util/gen-types/src/extension/calc_hash.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input, violating shared production helpers must be deterministic, bounded, and canonical for all security-relevant callers, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `util/gen-types/src/extension/calc_hash.rs::calc_header_hash`
- Entrypoint: a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates
- Attacker controls: local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior
- Exploit idea: trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input
- Invariant to test: shared production helpers must be deterministic, bounded, and canonical for all security-relevant callers
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

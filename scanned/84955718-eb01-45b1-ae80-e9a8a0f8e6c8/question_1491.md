# Q1491: High network batch interaction bug in From

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses through a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads so `From` in `network/src/network_group.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload, violating peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/network_group.rs::From`
- Entrypoint: a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads
- Attacker controls: header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses
- Exploit idea: trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload
- Invariant to test: peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

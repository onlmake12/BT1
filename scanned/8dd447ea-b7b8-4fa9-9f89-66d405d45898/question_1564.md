# Q1564: Critical network restart reorg persistence in is_ok

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses through a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads, then force normal restart, reorg, retry, or replay handling so `is_ok` in `network/src/peer_store/mod.rs` persists inconsistent state and cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied, violating sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/peer_store/mod.rs::is_ok`
- Entrypoint: a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads
- Attacker controls: header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses
- Exploit idea: cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied
- Invariant to test: sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

# Q1845: Critical network resource amplification in watch_new_block

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing through a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records to make `watch_new_block` in `notify/src/lib.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload, violating peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `notify/src/lib.rs::watch_new_block`
- Entrypoint: a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records
- Attacker controls: peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing
- Exploit idea: trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload
- Invariant to test: peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

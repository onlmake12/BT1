# Q748: High core state transition mismatch in consensus

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module and sequence local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior so `consensus` in `util/constant/src/consensus.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow make canonical serialization or conversion accept an ambiguous representation, violating caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `util/constant/src/consensus.rs::consensus`
- Entrypoint: a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module
- Attacker controls: local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior
- Exploit idea: make canonical serialization or conversion accept an ambiguous representation
- Invariant to test: caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

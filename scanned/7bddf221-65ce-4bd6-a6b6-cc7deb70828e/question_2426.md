# Q2426: Low rpc limit off by one in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for RPC batch size, malformed hex/bytes, pagination direction, filter shape, and repeated polling cadence through an indexer/RPC client requesting adversarial ranges, filters, cursors, and pagination values so `lib` in `util/rich-indexer/src/lib.rs` make RPC/indexer code panic or allocate heavily before validation clamps the request, violating RPC/indexer/helper state must match canonical chain state after reorg, restart, and pagination, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `util/rich-indexer/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: an indexer/RPC client requesting adversarial ranges, filters, cursors, and pagination values
- Attacker controls: RPC batch size, malformed hex/bytes, pagination direction, filter shape, and repeated polling cadence
- Exploit idea: make RPC/indexer code panic or allocate heavily before validation clamps the request
- Invariant to test: RPC/indexer/helper state must match canonical chain state after reorg, restart, and pagination
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.

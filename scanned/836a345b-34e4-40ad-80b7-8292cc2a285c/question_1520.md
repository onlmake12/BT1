# Q1520: Critical network resource amplification in count

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing through a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records to make `count` in `network/src/peer_store/addr_manager.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply, violating sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/peer_store/addr_manager.rs::count`
- Entrypoint: a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records
- Attacker controls: peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing
- Exploit idea: desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply
- Invariant to test: sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

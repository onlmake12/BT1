# Q3718: High vm state transition mismatch in suspend

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a block relayer executing transactions at VM-version or hardfork activation boundaries and sequence RISC-V bytecode, argv/env, witness bytes, syscall offsets, lengths, indexes, and source selectors so `suspend` in `script/src/scheduler.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow undercharge cycles or bypass a failure path by racing spawn/exec/read/write state transitions, violating cycle accounting and process state must remain bounded and cannot be bypassed by crafted scripts, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/scheduler.rs::suspend`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer executing transactions at VM-version or hardfork activation boundaries
- Attacker controls: RISC-V bytecode, argv/env, witness bytes, syscall offsets, lengths, indexes, and source selectors
- Exploit idea: undercharge cycles or bypass a failure path by racing spawn/exec/read/write state transitions
- Invariant to test: cycle accounting and process state must remain bounded and cannot be bypassed by crafted scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

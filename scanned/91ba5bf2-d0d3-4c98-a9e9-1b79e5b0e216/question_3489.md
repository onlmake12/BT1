# Q3489: Critical txpool canonical encoding ambiguity in get_tx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for verify-queue ordering, recent-reject keys, pool capacity pressure, and reorg timing through a local miner process selecting proposals and uncles near limit boundaries so `get_tx` in `tx-pool/src/component/pool_map.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and pollute orphan/recent-reject/verification queues so one attacker consumes disproportionate resources, violating tx-pool admission must remain a safe prefilter for consensus block verification, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `tx-pool/src/component/pool_map.rs::get_tx`
- Entrypoint: a local miner process selecting proposals and uncles near limit boundaries
- Attacker controls: verify-queue ordering, recent-reject keys, pool capacity pressure, and reorg timing
- Exploit idea: pollute orphan/recent-reject/verification queues so one attacker consumes disproportionate resources
- Invariant to test: tx-pool admission must remain a safe prefilter for consensus block verification
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Simulate tx-pool submission, orphan/recent-reject transitions, and block-template assembly; assert bounded queues and consensus-valid output.

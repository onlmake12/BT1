# Q1593: High network batch interaction bug in mark_tried

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing through a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages so `mark_tried` in `network/src/peer_store/types.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied, violating P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/peer_store/types.rs::mark_tried`
- Entrypoint: a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages
- Attacker controls: peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing
- Exploit idea: cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied
- Invariant to test: P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

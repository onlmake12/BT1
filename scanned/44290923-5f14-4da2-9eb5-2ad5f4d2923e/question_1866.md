# Q1866: Critical network limit off by one in GetBlockFiltersProcess

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses through a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages so `GetBlockFiltersProcess` in `sync/src/filter/get_block_filters_process.rs` desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply, violating P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/filter/get_block_filters_process.rs::GetBlockFiltersProcess`
- Entrypoint: a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages
- Attacker controls: header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses
- Exploit idea: desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply
- Invariant to test: P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

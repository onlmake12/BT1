# Q3449: Critical txpool cross module inconsistency in transaction

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a local miner process selecting proposals and uncles near limit boundaries to make `transaction` in `tx-pool/src/component/entry.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make block assembly include invalid, duplicate, or economically wrong transactions or rewards, violating tx-pool admission must remain a safe prefilter for consensus block verification, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `tx-pool/src/component/entry.rs::transaction`
- Entrypoint: a local miner process selecting proposals and uncles near limit boundaries
- Attacker controls: verify-queue ordering, recent-reject keys, pool capacity pressure, and reorg timing
- Exploit idea: make block assembly include invalid, duplicate, or economically wrong transactions or rewards
- Invariant to test: tx-pool admission must remain a safe prefilter for consensus block verification
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Simulate tx-pool submission, orphan/recent-reject transitions, and block-template assembly; assert bounded queues and consensus-valid output.

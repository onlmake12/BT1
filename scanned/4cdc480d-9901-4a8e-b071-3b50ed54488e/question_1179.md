# Q1179: Critical crypto parser precheck gap in secp

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit malformed-but-reachable script args, witness lock fields, pubkey hash matching, and conversion boundaries through a block relayer supplying Merkle/MMR/proof-related data at boundary lengths so `secp` in `util/crypto/src/secp/mod.rs` performs expensive or unsafe work before validation and trigger inconsistent serialization or byte-order interpretation between consensus and API paths, violating hash, Merkle, MMR, and fixed-byte conversions must be canonical across consensus and RPC paths, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `util/crypto/src/secp/mod.rs::secp`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer supplying Merkle/MMR/proof-related data at boundary lengths
- Attacker controls: script args, witness lock fields, pubkey hash matching, and conversion boundaries
- Exploit idea: trigger inconsistent serialization or byte-order interpretation between consensus and API paths
- Invariant to test: hash, Merkle, MMR, and fixed-byte conversions must be canonical across consensus and RPC paths
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Add a property or unit test over signatures, hashes, proofs, and encodings; assert malformed variants reject without panic.

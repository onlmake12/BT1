# Q906: High core cache invalidation failure in CellOutput

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates to alternate valid and invalid message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs so `CellOutput` in `util/gen-types/src/extension/capacity.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers, violating shared production helpers must be deterministic, bounded, and canonical for all security-relevant callers, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/gen-types/src/extension/capacity.rs::CellOutput`
- Entrypoint: a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates
- Attacker controls: message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs
- Exploit idea: make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers
- Invariant to test: shared production helpers must be deterministic, bounded, and canonical for all security-relevant callers
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

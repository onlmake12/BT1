# Q1058: High core resource amplification in Unpack

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs through a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates to make `Unpack` in `util/types/src/conversion/blockchain.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input, violating caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/conversion/blockchain.rs::Unpack`
- Entrypoint: a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates
- Attacker controls: message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs
- Exploit idea: trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input
- Invariant to test: caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

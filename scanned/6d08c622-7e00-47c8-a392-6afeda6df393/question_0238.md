# Q238: High cli canonical encoding ambiguity in file_name

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for TOML config values, resource templates, default directories, sentry/log/metrics settings, and process state through an operator-facing component processing log, metrics, memory, runtime, or launcher state so `file_name` in `util/instrument/src/export.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and cause important performance degradation in a default-enabled operator path with small local input, violating import/export/replay/migration behavior must match production validation and storage invariants, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/instrument/src/export.rs::file_name`
- Entrypoint: an operator-facing component processing log, metrics, memory, runtime, or launcher state
- Attacker controls: TOML config values, resource templates, default directories, sentry/log/metrics settings, and process state
- Exploit idea: cause important performance degradation in a default-enabled operator path with small local input
- Invariant to test: import/export/replay/migration behavior must match production validation and storage invariants
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Run the supported CLI/config path in a temp directory with crafted local input; assert clean error, no state corruption, and bounded runtime.

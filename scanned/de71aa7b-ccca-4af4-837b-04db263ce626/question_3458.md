# Q3458: Critical txpool parser precheck gap in remove

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit malformed-but-reachable verify-queue ordering, recent-reject keys, pool capacity pressure, and reorg timing through a peer relaying transactions that race recent-reject, orphan, and verification-queue state so `remove` in `tx-pool/src/component/links.rs` performs expensive or unsafe work before validation and make tx-pool policy accept a transaction that block verification later rejects, or reject valid traffic cheaply, violating valid user transactions must not be persistently censored by cheap attacker-created pool state, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `tx-pool/src/component/links.rs::remove`
- Entrypoint: a peer relaying transactions that race recent-reject, orphan, and verification-queue state
- Attacker controls: verify-queue ordering, recent-reject keys, pool capacity pressure, and reorg timing
- Exploit idea: make tx-pool policy accept a transaction that block verification later rejects, or reject valid traffic cheaply
- Invariant to test: valid user transactions must not be persistently censored by cheap attacker-created pool state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Simulate tx-pool submission, orphan/recent-reject transitions, and block-template assembly; assert bounded queues and consensus-valid output.

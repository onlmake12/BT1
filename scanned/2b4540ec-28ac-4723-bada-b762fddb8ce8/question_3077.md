# Q3077: High transaction cache invalidation failure in new

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a transaction sender submitting crafted inputs, outputs, deps, witnesses, and since values to alternate valid and invalid input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries so `new` in `util/light-client-protocol-server/src/components/get_transactions_proof.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and make non-contextual, contextual, and tx-pool verification disagree about the same transaction, violating capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `util/light-client-protocol-server/src/components/get_transactions_proof.rs::new`
- Entrypoint: a transaction sender submitting crafted inputs, outputs, deps, witnesses, and since values
- Attacker controls: input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries
- Exploit idea: make non-contextual, contextual, and tx-pool verification disagree about the same transaction
- Invariant to test: capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

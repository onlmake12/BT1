# Q1485: High network resource amplification in with_peer_registry

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses through a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records to make `with_peer_registry` in `network/src/network.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply, violating peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/network.rs::with_peer_registry`
- Entrypoint: a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records
- Attacker controls: header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses
- Exploit idea: desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply
- Invariant to test: peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

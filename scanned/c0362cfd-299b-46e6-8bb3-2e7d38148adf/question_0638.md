# Q638: Critical consensus resource amplification in TimestampError

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small uncle lists, proposal IDs, block extension bytes, transaction roots, and DAO fields through a sync peer delivering reordered headers, uncles, and block extensions to make `TimestampError` in `verification/src/error.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and make fork-choice or delayed verification commit a block whose derived roots or epoch data disagree with recalculation, violating invalid PoW, epoch, uncle, proposal, extension, DAO, or root data must never become canonical, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `verification/src/error.rs::TimestampError`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering reordered headers, uncles, and block extensions
- Attacker controls: uncle lists, proposal IDs, block extension bytes, transaction roots, and DAO fields
- Exploit idea: make fork-choice or delayed verification commit a block whose derived roots or epoch data disagree with recalculation
- Invariant to test: invalid PoW, epoch, uncle, proposal, extension, DAO, or root data must never become canonical
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

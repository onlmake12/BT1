# Q3612: High txpool resource amplification in constants

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small transaction fee, size, cycles, deps, ancestor/descendant graph, orphan parents, and proposal status through a peer relaying transactions that race recent-reject, orphan, and verification-queue state to make `constants` in `util/fee-estimator/src/constants.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and make block assembly include invalid, duplicate, or economically wrong transactions or rewards, violating valid user transactions must not be persistently censored by cheap attacker-created pool state, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `util/fee-estimator/src/constants.rs::constants`
- Entrypoint: a peer relaying transactions that race recent-reject, orphan, and verification-queue state
- Attacker controls: transaction fee, size, cycles, deps, ancestor/descendant graph, orphan parents, and proposal status
- Exploit idea: make block assembly include invalid, duplicate, or economically wrong transactions or rewards
- Invariant to test: valid user transactions must not be persistently censored by cheap attacker-created pool state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Simulate tx-pool submission, orphan/recent-reject transitions, and block-template assembly; assert bounded queues and consensus-valid output.

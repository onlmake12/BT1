# Q2716: Medium storage state transition mismatch in freezer

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an operator replay/import/restart after attacker-shaped blocks, transactions, or indexes were persisted and sequence cache pressure, rollback order, canonical/forked block alternation, and missing extension/filter data so `freezer` in `store/src/snapshot.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow trigger database/freezer/migration panic or unrecoverable state from attacker-shaped accepted data, violating persisted CKB state must remain canonical, recoverable, and internally consistent across reorg/restart, causing Medium (2001 - 10000 points). Suboptimal implementation of CKB state storage mechanism?

## Target
- File/function: `store/src/snapshot.rs::freezer`
- Entrypoint: an operator replay/import/restart after attacker-shaped blocks, transactions, or indexes were persisted
- Attacker controls: cache pressure, rollback order, canonical/forked block alternation, and missing extension/filter data
- Exploit idea: trigger database/freezer/migration panic or unrecoverable state from attacker-shaped accepted data
- Invariant to test: persisted CKB state must remain canonical, recoverable, and internally consistent across reorg/restart
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium (2001 - 10000 points). Suboptimal implementation of CKB state storage mechanism
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

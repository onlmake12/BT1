# Q2048: High network replay reorder race in default

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker replay, reorder, or delay compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs through a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages so `default` in `sync/src/types/mod.rs` takes a stale branch and make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse, breaking the invariant that sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/types/mod.rs::default`
- Entrypoint: a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages
- Attacker controls: compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs
- Exploit idea: make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse
- Invariant to test: sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

# Q1913: High network cross module inconsistency in execute

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads to make `execute` in `sync/src/relayer/block_proposal_process.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse, violating P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/relayer/block_proposal_process.rs::execute`
- Entrypoint: a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads
- Attacker controls: header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses
- Exploit idea: make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse
- Invariant to test: P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

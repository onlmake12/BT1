# Q1701: Critical network resource amplification in connected

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses through a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks to make `connected` in `network/src/protocols/hole_punching/mod.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse, violating P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/protocols/hole_punching/mod.rs::connected`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks
- Attacker controls: header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses
- Exploit idea: make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse
- Invariant to test: P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

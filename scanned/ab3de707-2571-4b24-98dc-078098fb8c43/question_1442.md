# Q1442: High network differential path split in score

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `score` in `network/src/behaviour.rs` through two production paths from a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages and make one path accept while the other rejects because of message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths, violating P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/behaviour.rs::score`
- Entrypoint: a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages
- Attacker controls: message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths
- Exploit idea: trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload
- Invariant to test: P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

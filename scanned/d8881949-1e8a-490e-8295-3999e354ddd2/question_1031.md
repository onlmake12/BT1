# Q1031: High core cross module inconsistency in check_if_identifier_is_valid

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data to make `check_if_identifier_is_valid` in `util/src/strings.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers, violating caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `util/src/strings.rs::check_if_identifier_is_valid`
- Entrypoint: a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data
- Attacker controls: message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs
- Exploit idea: make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers
- Invariant to test: caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

# Q1555: High network resource amplification in shutdown

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs through a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks to make `shutdown` in `network/src/peer_store/browser.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload, violating peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/peer_store/browser.rs::shutdown`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks
- Attacker controls: compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs
- Exploit idea: trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload
- Invariant to test: peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

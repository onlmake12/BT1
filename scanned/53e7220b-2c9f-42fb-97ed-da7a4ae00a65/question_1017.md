# Q1017: High core cross module inconsistency in with_capacity

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module to make `with_capacity` in `util/src/linked_hash_set.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input, violating caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/src/linked_hash_set.rs::with_capacity`
- Entrypoint: a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module
- Attacker controls: local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior
- Exploit idea: trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input
- Invariant to test: caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

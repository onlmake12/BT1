# Q395: Critical consensus state transition mismatch in execute_callback

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects and sequence header timestamp, compact target, epoch fraction, nonce, parent hash, and block number so `execute_callback` in `chain/src/lib.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow make fork-choice or delayed verification commit a block whose derived roots or epoch data disagree with recalculation, violating malformed consensus objects must return structured errors without node panic or unbounded work, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/src/lib.rs::execute_callback`
- Entrypoint: an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects
- Attacker controls: header timestamp, compact target, epoch fraction, nonce, parent hash, and block number
- Exploit idea: make fork-choice or delayed verification commit a block whose derived roots or epoch data disagree with recalculation
- Invariant to test: malformed consensus objects must return structured errors without node panic or unbounded work
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

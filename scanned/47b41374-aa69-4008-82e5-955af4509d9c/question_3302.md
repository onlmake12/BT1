# Q3302: Critical transaction batch interaction bug in build

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch cell deps, header deps, witnesses, lock/type args, output data lengths, and capacity values through a transaction sender submitting crafted inputs, outputs, deps, witnesses, and since values so `build` in `util/types/src/core/transaction_meta.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization, violating capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/core/transaction_meta.rs::build`
- Entrypoint: a transaction sender submitting crafted inputs, outputs, deps, witnesses, and since values
- Attacker controls: cell deps, header deps, witnesses, lock/type args, output data lengths, and capacity values
- Exploit idea: bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization
- Invariant to test: capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

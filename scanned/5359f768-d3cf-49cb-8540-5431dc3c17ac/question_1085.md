# Q1085: High core canonical encoding ambiguity in From

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for conversion inputs, collection lengths, duplicate identifiers, empty values, and maximum-size payloads through an unprivileged peer, RPC caller, or transaction sender reaching this shared module through production paths so `From` in `util/types/src/conversion/utilities.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input, violating shared production helpers must be deterministic, bounded, and canonical for all security-relevant callers, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/conversion/utilities.rs::From`
- Entrypoint: an unprivileged peer, RPC caller, or transaction sender reaching this shared module through production paths
- Attacker controls: conversion inputs, collection lengths, duplicate identifiers, empty values, and maximum-size payloads
- Exploit idea: trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input
- Invariant to test: shared production helpers must be deterministic, bounded, and canonical for all security-relevant callers
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

# Q1280: Critical crypto batch interaction bug in Default

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch Merkle leaves, proof ordering, duplicate hashes, empty roots, and MMR positions through a transaction sender supplying crafted signatures, hashes, script args, and witness data so `Default` in `util/fixed-hash/core/src/std_default.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and panic or overrun a cryptographic parser before a malformed object is rejected, violating cryptographic checks must bind exactly to the intended message, domain, key, threshold, and serialized bytes, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `util/fixed-hash/core/src/std_default.rs::Default`
- Entrypoint: a transaction sender supplying crafted signatures, hashes, script args, and witness data
- Attacker controls: Merkle leaves, proof ordering, duplicate hashes, empty roots, and MMR positions
- Exploit idea: panic or overrun a cryptographic parser before a malformed object is rejected
- Invariant to test: cryptographic checks must bind exactly to the intended message, domain, key, threshold, and serialized bytes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Add a property or unit test over signatures, hashes, proofs, and encodings; assert malformed variants reject without panic.

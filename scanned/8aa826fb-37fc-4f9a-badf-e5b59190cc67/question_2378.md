# Q2378: High rpc canonical encoding ambiguity in constant

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for RPC batch size, malformed hex/bytes, pagination direction, filter shape, and repeated polling cadence through a light-client protocol caller requesting proofs and filters across reorg boundaries so `constant` in `util/light-client-protocol-server/src/constant.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and amplify storage scans or proof generation with small crafted RPC requests, violating local RPC APIs must validate all caller-controlled parameters and fail without process crash, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/light-client-protocol-server/src/constant.rs::constant`
- Entrypoint: a light-client protocol caller requesting proofs and filters across reorg boundaries
- Attacker controls: RPC batch size, malformed hex/bytes, pagination direction, filter shape, and repeated polling cadence
- Exploit idea: amplify storage scans or proof generation with small crafted RPC requests
- Invariant to test: local RPC APIs must validate all caller-controlled parameters and fail without process crash
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.

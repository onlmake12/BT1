# Q3036: High transaction restart reorg persistence in new

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries through a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block, then force normal restart, reorg, retry, or replay handling so `new` in `util/dao/src/lib.rs` persists inconsistent state and bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization, violating capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `util/dao/src/lib.rs::new`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block
- Attacker controls: input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries
- Exploit idea: bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization
- Invariant to test: capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

# Q952: High core limit off by one in new_cellbase_input

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs through a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module so `new_cellbase_input` in `util/gen-types/src/extension/shortcut.rs` make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers, violating shared production helpers must be deterministic, bounded, and canonical for all security-relevant callers, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/gen-types/src/extension/shortcut.rs::new_cellbase_input`
- Entrypoint: a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module
- Attacker controls: message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs
- Exploit idea: make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers
- Invariant to test: shared production helpers must be deterministic, bounded, and canonical for all security-relevant callers
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

# Q3001: Critical transaction cross module inconsistency in HeaderFields

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block to make `HeaderFields` in `traits/src/header_provider.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make dependency resolution use a different cell/header than the script-visible authorization path, violating transactions cannot spend cells without satisfying lock/type script authorization, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `traits/src/header_provider.rs::HeaderFields`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block
- Attacker controls: input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries
- Exploit idea: make dependency resolution use a different cell/header than the script-visible authorization path
- Invariant to test: transactions cannot spend cells without satisfying lock/type script authorization
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

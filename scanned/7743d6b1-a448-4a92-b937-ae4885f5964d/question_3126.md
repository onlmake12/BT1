# Q3126: Critical transaction cross module inconsistency in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a script author referencing edge-case cells, headers, DAO data, and occupied-capacity values to make `lib` in `util/occupied-capacity/src/lib.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization, violating resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `util/occupied-capacity/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a script author referencing edge-case cells, headers, DAO data, and occupied-capacity values
- Attacker controls: input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries
- Exploit idea: bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization
- Invariant to test: resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

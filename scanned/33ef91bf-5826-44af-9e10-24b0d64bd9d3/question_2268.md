# Q2268: Low rpc state transition mismatch in EstimateMode

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a light-client protocol caller requesting proofs and filters across reorg boundaries and sequence block/template parameters, transaction payloads, fee-rate values, and debug/experiment options so `EstimateMode` in `util/jsonrpc-types/src/fee_estimator.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow amplify storage scans or proof generation with small crafted RPC requests, violating proof, filter, and index queries must remain bounded and not expose stale security-relevant data, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `util/jsonrpc-types/src/fee_estimator.rs::EstimateMode`
- Entrypoint: a light-client protocol caller requesting proofs and filters across reorg boundaries
- Attacker controls: block/template parameters, transaction payloads, fee-rate values, and debug/experiment options
- Exploit idea: amplify storage scans or proof generation with small crafted RPC requests
- Invariant to test: proof, filter, and index queries must remain bounded and not expose stale security-relevant data
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.

# Q1773: Critical network cache invalidation failure in parse_socks5_url

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records to alternate valid and invalid header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses so `parse_socks5_url` in `network/src/proxy.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply, violating sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/proxy.rs::parse_socks5_url`
- Entrypoint: a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records
- Attacker controls: header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses
- Exploit idea: desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply
- Invariant to test: sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

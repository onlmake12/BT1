# Q3027: High transaction canonical encoding ambiguity in cell

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for canonical cell status before and after reorg, snapshot lookup results, and dep-group layout through a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block so `cell` in `tx-pool/src/pool_cell.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and make dependency resolution use a different cell/header than the script-visible authorization path, violating capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `tx-pool/src/pool_cell.rs::cell`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block
- Attacker controls: canonical cell status before and after reorg, snapshot lookup results, and dep-group layout
- Exploit idea: make dependency resolution use a different cell/header than the script-visible authorization path
- Invariant to test: capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

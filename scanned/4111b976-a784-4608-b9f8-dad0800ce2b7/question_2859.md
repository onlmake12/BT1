# Q2859: Medium storage cross module inconsistency in versionbits_active

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use an operator replay/import/restart after attacker-shaped blocks, transactions, or indexes were persisted to make `versionbits_active` in `util/snapshot/src/lib.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where trigger database/freezer/migration panic or unrecoverable state from attacker-shaped accepted data, violating database writes, freezer state, migrations, and snapshots must be atomic for security-relevant data, causing Medium (2001 - 10000 points). Suboptimal implementation of CKB state storage mechanism?

## Target
- File/function: `util/snapshot/src/lib.rs::versionbits_active`
- Entrypoint: an operator replay/import/restart after attacker-shaped blocks, transactions, or indexes were persisted
- Attacker controls: cache pressure, rollback order, canonical/forked block alternation, and missing extension/filter data
- Exploit idea: trigger database/freezer/migration panic or unrecoverable state from attacker-shaped accepted data
- Invariant to test: database writes, freezer state, migrations, and snapshots must be atomic for security-relevant data
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium (2001 - 10000 points). Suboptimal implementation of CKB state storage mechanism
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

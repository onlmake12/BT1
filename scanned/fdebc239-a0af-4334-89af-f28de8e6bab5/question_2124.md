# Q2124: High rpc cross module inconsistency in module

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters to make `module` in `rpc/src/module/mod.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make RPC/indexer code panic or allocate heavily before validation clamps the request, violating RPC submission paths must not bypass consensus, tx-pool, or block-template validation, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc/src/module/mod.rs::module`
- Entrypoint: a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters
- Attacker controls: RPC batch size, malformed hex/bytes, pagination direction, filter shape, and repeated polling cadence
- Exploit idea: make RPC/indexer code panic or allocate heavily before validation clamps the request
- Invariant to test: RPC submission paths must not bypass consensus, tx-pool, or block-template validation
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.

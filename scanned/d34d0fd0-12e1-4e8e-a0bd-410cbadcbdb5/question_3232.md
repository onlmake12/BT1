# Q3232: Critical transaction batch interaction bug in Display

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries through a transaction sender submitting crafted inputs, outputs, deps, witnesses, and since values so `Display` in `util/types/src/core/fee_rate.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and make dependency resolution use a different cell/header than the script-visible authorization path, violating resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/core/fee_rate.rs::Display`
- Entrypoint: a transaction sender submitting crafted inputs, outputs, deps, witnesses, and since values
- Attacker controls: input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries
- Exploit idea: make dependency resolution use a different cell/header than the script-visible authorization path
- Invariant to test: resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

# Q3974: Critical vm batch interaction bug in from_cell_meta

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch RISC-V bytecode, argv/env, witness bytes, syscall offsets, lengths, indexes, and source selectors through a script author invoking syscalls with boundary offsets, lengths, file descriptors, and process handles so `from_cell_meta` in `script/src/types.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and make VM version gating select the wrong behavior at a hardfork boundary, violating cycle accounting and process state must remain bounded and cannot be bypassed by crafted scripts, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/types.rs::from_cell_meta`
- Entrypoint: a script author invoking syscalls with boundary offsets, lengths, file descriptors, and process handles
- Attacker controls: RISC-V bytecode, argv/env, witness bytes, syscall offsets, lengths, indexes, and source selectors
- Exploit idea: make VM version gating select the wrong behavior at a hardfork boundary
- Invariant to test: cycle accounting and process state must remain bounded and cannot be bypassed by crafted scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

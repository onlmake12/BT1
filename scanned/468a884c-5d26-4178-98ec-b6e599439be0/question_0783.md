# Q783: High core canonical encoding ambiguity in testnet

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs through a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates so `testnet` in `util/constant/src/hardfork/testnet.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers, violating shared production helpers must be deterministic, bounded, and canonical for all security-relevant callers, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `util/constant/src/hardfork/testnet.rs::testnet`
- Entrypoint: a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates
- Attacker controls: message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs
- Exploit idea: make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers
- Invariant to test: shared production helpers must be deterministic, bounded, and canonical for all security-relevant callers
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

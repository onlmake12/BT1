# Q2517: High storage restart reorg persistence in const_handle

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape database column contents derived from accepted blocks, freezer boundaries, migration versions, and write-batch size through a peer-driven chain/reorg sequence that writes adversarial canonical and fork state, then force normal restart, reorg, retry, or replay handling so `const_handle` in `db/src/snapshot.rs` persists inconsistent state and lose, duplicate, or stale-cache cells/headers across snapshots and write batches, violating database writes, freezer state, migrations, and snapshots must be atomic for security-relevant data, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `db/src/snapshot.rs::const_handle`
- Entrypoint: a peer-driven chain/reorg sequence that writes adversarial canonical and fork state
- Attacker controls: database column contents derived from accepted blocks, freezer boundaries, migration versions, and write-batch size
- Exploit idea: lose, duplicate, or stale-cache cells/headers across snapshots and write batches
- Invariant to test: database writes, freezer state, migrations, and snapshots must be atomic for security-relevant data
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

# Q2618: Critical storage resource amplification in remove_no_return

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small block order, reorg depth, cell lifetimes, transaction metadata, header maps, and snapshot timing through an operator replay/import/restart after attacker-shaped blocks, transactions, or indexes were persisted to make `remove_no_return` in `shared/src/types/header_map/backend.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and lose, duplicate, or stale-cache cells/headers across snapshots and write batches, violating persisted CKB state must remain canonical, recoverable, and internally consistent across reorg/restart, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `shared/src/types/header_map/backend.rs::remove_no_return`
- Entrypoint: an operator replay/import/restart after attacker-shaped blocks, transactions, or indexes were persisted
- Attacker controls: block order, reorg depth, cell lifetimes, transaction metadata, header maps, and snapshot timing
- Exploit idea: lose, duplicate, or stale-cache cells/headers across snapshots and write batches
- Invariant to test: persisted CKB state must remain canonical, recoverable, and internally consistent across reorg/restart
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

# Q928: High core resource amplification in extension

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior through an unprivileged peer, RPC caller, or transaction sender reaching this shared module through production paths to make `extension` in `util/gen-types/src/extension/mod.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and break a resource bound or state transition that downstream modules assume is already enforced, violating module-level assumptions must hold across consensus, network, RPC, storage, and tx-pool paths, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/gen-types/src/extension/mod.rs::extension`
- Entrypoint: an unprivileged peer, RPC caller, or transaction sender reaching this shared module through production paths
- Attacker controls: local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior
- Exploit idea: break a resource bound or state transition that downstream modules assume is already enforced
- Invariant to test: module-level assumptions must hold across consensus, network, RPC, storage, and tx-pool paths
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

# Q861: High core parser precheck gap in conversion

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit malformed-but-reachable conversion inputs, collection lengths, duplicate identifiers, empty values, and maximum-size payloads through a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module so `conversion` in `util/gen-types/src/conversion/mod.rs` performs expensive or unsafe work before validation and make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers, violating module-level assumptions must hold across consensus, network, RPC, storage, and tx-pool paths, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `util/gen-types/src/conversion/mod.rs::conversion`
- Entrypoint: a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module
- Attacker controls: conversion inputs, collection lengths, duplicate identifiers, empty values, and maximum-size payloads
- Exploit idea: make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers
- Invariant to test: module-level assumptions must hold across consensus, network, RPC, storage, and tx-pool paths
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

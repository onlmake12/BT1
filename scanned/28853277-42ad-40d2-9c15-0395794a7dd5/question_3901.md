# Q3901: High vm resource amplification in Read

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small spawn/exec metadata, pipe/read/write order, inherited fds, process IDs, and wait/close timing through a block relayer executing transactions at VM-version or hardfork activation boundaries to make `Read` in `script/src/syscalls/read.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and trigger a VM panic or host-side bounds error before the transaction is rejected, violating CKB-VM and syscall behavior must be deterministic and consensus-equivalent across nodes, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/syscalls/read.rs::Read`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer executing transactions at VM-version or hardfork activation boundaries
- Attacker controls: spawn/exec metadata, pipe/read/write order, inherited fds, process IDs, and wait/close timing
- Exploit idea: trigger a VM panic or host-side bounds error before the transaction is rejected
- Invariant to test: CKB-VM and syscall behavior must be deterministic and consensus-equivalent across nodes
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

# Q623: Critical consensus limit off by one in convert

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for uncle lists, proposal IDs, block extension bytes, transaction roots, and DAO fields through an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects so `convert` in `verification/src/convert.rs` make contextual verification consume stale parent or epoch state after a reorg/orphan transition, violating fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `verification/src/convert.rs::convert`
- Entrypoint: an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects
- Attacker controls: uncle lists, proposal IDs, block extension bytes, transaction roots, and DAO fields
- Exploit idea: make contextual verification consume stale parent or epoch state after a reorg/orphan transition
- Invariant to test: fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

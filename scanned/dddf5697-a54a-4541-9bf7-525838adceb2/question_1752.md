# Q1752: Critical network restart reorg persistence in new

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths through a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages, then force normal restart, reorg, retry, or replay handling so `new` in `network/src/protocols/ping.rs` persists inconsistent state and make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse, violating peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/protocols/ping.rs::new`
- Entrypoint: a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages
- Attacker controls: message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths
- Exploit idea: make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse
- Invariant to test: peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

# Q747: Low core batch interaction bug in consensus

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs through a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data so `consensus` in `util/constant/src/consensus.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input, violating caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `util/constant/src/consensus.rs::consensus`
- Entrypoint: a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data
- Attacker controls: message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs
- Exploit idea: trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input
- Invariant to test: caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

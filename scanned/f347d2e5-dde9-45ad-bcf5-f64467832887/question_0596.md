# Q596: Critical consensus cache invalidation failure in consensus

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects to alternate valid and invalid header timestamp, compact target, epoch fraction, nonce, parent hash, and block number so `consensus` in `verification/contextual/src/uncles_verifier.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and make fork-choice or delayed verification commit a block whose derived roots or epoch data disagree with recalculation, violating all honest nodes must deterministically accept and reject the same blocks under the same consensus spec, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `verification/contextual/src/uncles_verifier.rs::consensus`
- Entrypoint: an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects
- Attacker controls: header timestamp, compact target, epoch fraction, nonce, parent hash, and block number
- Exploit idea: make fork-choice or delayed verification commit a block whose derived roots or epoch data disagree with recalculation
- Invariant to test: all honest nodes must deterministically accept and reject the same blocks under the same consensus spec
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

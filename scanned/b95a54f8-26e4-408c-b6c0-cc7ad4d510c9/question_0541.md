# Q541: Critical consensus cross module inconsistency in cellbase_maturity

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a sync peer delivering reordered headers, uncles, and block extensions to make `cellbase_maturity` in `spec/src/lib.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where trigger an arithmetic, encoding, or target-conversion edge before the normal consensus rejection path, violating fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `spec/src/lib.rs::cellbase_maturity`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering reordered headers, uncles, and block extensions
- Attacker controls: genesis/spec fields on a private chain and canonical block metadata during replay
- Exploit idea: trigger an arithmetic, encoding, or target-conversion edge before the normal consensus rejection path
- Invariant to test: fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

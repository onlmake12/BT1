# Q2453: High storage cache invalidation failure in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a sync peer causing repeated rollback, truncation, migration, or state lookup edge cases to alternate valid and invalid block order, reorg depth, cell lifetimes, transaction metadata, header maps, and snapshot timing so `lib` in `db-schema/src/lib.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and trigger database/freezer/migration panic or unrecoverable state from attacker-shaped accepted data, violating database writes, freezer state, migrations, and snapshots must be atomic for security-relevant data, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `db-schema/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer causing repeated rollback, truncation, migration, or state lookup edge cases
- Attacker controls: block order, reorg depth, cell lifetimes, transaction metadata, header maps, and snapshot timing
- Exploit idea: trigger database/freezer/migration panic or unrecoverable state from attacker-shaped accepted data
- Invariant to test: database writes, freezer state, migrations, and snapshots must be atomic for security-relevant data
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

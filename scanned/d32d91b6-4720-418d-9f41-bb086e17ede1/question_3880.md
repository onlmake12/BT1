# Q3880: High vm cache invalidation failure in initialize

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a malicious script spawning or execing child processes with adversarial inherited descriptors and pipes to alternate valid and invalid malformed buffers, return codes, memory pointers, and script group composition so `initialize` in `script/src/syscalls/pause.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and make VM version gating select the wrong behavior at a hardfork boundary, violating cycle accounting and process state must remain bounded and cannot be bypassed by crafted scripts, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/syscalls/pause.rs::initialize`
- Entrypoint: a malicious script spawning or execing child processes with adversarial inherited descriptors and pipes
- Attacker controls: malformed buffers, return codes, memory pointers, and script group composition
- Exploit idea: make VM version gating select the wrong behavior at a hardfork boundary
- Invariant to test: cycle accounting and process state must remain bounded and cannot be bypassed by crafted scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

# Q3740: High vm canonical encoding ambiguity in new

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for spawn/exec metadata, pipe/read/write order, inherited fds, process IDs, and wait/close timing through a malicious script spawning or execing child processes with adversarial inherited descriptors and pipes so `new` in `script/src/syscalls/current_cycles.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and undercharge cycles or bypass a failure path by racing spawn/exec/read/write state transitions, violating CKB-VM and syscall behavior must be deterministic and consensus-equivalent across nodes, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/syscalls/current_cycles.rs::new`
- Entrypoint: a malicious script spawning or execing child processes with adversarial inherited descriptors and pipes
- Attacker controls: spawn/exec metadata, pipe/read/write order, inherited fds, process IDs, and wait/close timing
- Exploit idea: undercharge cycles or bypass a failure path by racing spawn/exec/read/write state transitions
- Invariant to test: CKB-VM and syscall behavior must be deterministic and consensus-equivalent across nodes
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

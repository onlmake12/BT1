# Q259: High cli cross module inconsistency in check_spec

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a local command-line user invoking supported CKB subcommands with crafted arguments to make `check_spec` in `util/launcher/src/lib.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make generated defaults enable an unsafe resource or performance behavior in normal operation, violating import/export/replay/migration behavior must match production validation and storage invariants, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/launcher/src/lib.rs::check_spec`
- Entrypoint: a local command-line user invoking supported CKB subcommands with crafted arguments
- Attacker controls: CLI flags, file paths, chain spec choice, import/export ranges, replay targets, and migration options
- Exploit idea: make generated defaults enable an unsafe resource or performance behavior in normal operation
- Invariant to test: import/export/replay/migration behavior must match production validation and storage invariants
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Run the supported CLI/config path in a temp directory with crafted local input; assert clean error, no state corruption, and bounded runtime.

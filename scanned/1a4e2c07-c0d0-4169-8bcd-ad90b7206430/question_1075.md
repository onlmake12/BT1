# Q1075: High core cache invalidation failure in Pack

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use an unprivileged peer, RPC caller, or transaction sender reaching this shared module through production paths to alternate valid and invalid local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior so `Pack` in `util/types/src/conversion/storage.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and make canonical serialization or conversion accept an ambiguous representation, violating caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/conversion/storage.rs::Pack`
- Entrypoint: an unprivileged peer, RPC caller, or transaction sender reaching this shared module through production paths
- Attacker controls: local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior
- Exploit idea: make canonical serialization or conversion accept an ambiguous representation
- Invariant to test: caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

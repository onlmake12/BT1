# Q2046: High network cache invalidation failure in contains

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records to alternate valid and invalid message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths so `contains` in `sync/src/types/mod.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply, violating peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/types/mod.rs::contains`
- Entrypoint: a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records
- Attacker controls: message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths
- Exploit idea: desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply
- Invariant to test: peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

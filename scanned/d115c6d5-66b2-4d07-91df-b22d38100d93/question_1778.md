# Q1778: High network limit off by one in new

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs through a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records so `new` in `network/src/services/dns_seeding/mod.rs` desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply, violating sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/services/dns_seeding/mod.rs::new`
- Entrypoint: a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records
- Attacker controls: compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs
- Exploit idea: desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply
- Invariant to test: sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

# Q1061: High core state transition mismatch in from

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates and sequence serialized CKB objects, hashes, indexes, ranges, counts, options, and boundary numeric values so `from` in `util/types/src/conversion/blockchain.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers, violating module-level assumptions must hold across consensus, network, RPC, storage, and tx-pool paths, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/conversion/blockchain.rs::from`
- Entrypoint: a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates
- Attacker controls: serialized CKB objects, hashes, indexes, ranges, counts, options, and boundary numeric values
- Exploit idea: make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers
- Invariant to test: module-level assumptions must hold across consensus, network, RPC, storage, and tx-pool paths
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

# Q2708: High storage resource amplification in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small cache pressure, rollback order, canonical/forked block alternation, and missing extension/filter data through a node receiving valid-looking blocks that stress snapshots, caches, freezer, and write batches to make `lib` in `store/src/lib.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and lose, duplicate, or stale-cache cells/headers across snapshots and write batches, violating state storage mechanisms must not allow cheap corruption, excessive growth, or crash-on-restart, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `store/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a node receiving valid-looking blocks that stress snapshots, caches, freezer, and write batches
- Attacker controls: cache pressure, rollback order, canonical/forked block alternation, and missing extension/filter data
- Exploit idea: lose, duplicate, or stale-cache cells/headers across snapshots and write batches
- Invariant to test: state storage mechanisms must not allow cheap corruption, excessive growth, or crash-on-restart
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

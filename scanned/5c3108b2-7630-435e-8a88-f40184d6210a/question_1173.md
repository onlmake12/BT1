# Q1173: Critical crypto cross module inconsistency in random_keypair

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a block relayer supplying Merkle/MMR/proof-related data at boundary lengths to make `random_keypair` in `util/crypto/src/secp/generator.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where panic or overrun a cryptographic parser before a malformed object is rejected, violating malformed signatures, proofs, alerts, or hashes must never crash a node or bypass authorization, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `util/crypto/src/secp/generator.rs::random_keypair`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer supplying Merkle/MMR/proof-related data at boundary lengths
- Attacker controls: Merkle leaves, proof ordering, duplicate hashes, empty roots, and MMR positions
- Exploit idea: panic or overrun a cryptographic parser before a malformed object is rejected
- Invariant to test: malformed signatures, proofs, alerts, or hashes must never crash a node or bypass authorization
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Add a property or unit test over signatures, hashes, proofs, and encodings; assert malformed variants reject without panic.

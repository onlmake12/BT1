# Q3459: Critical txpool parser precheck gap in remove

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit malformed-but-reachable block template limits, tx selection order, uncle candidates, proposal IDs, and fee estimator samples through a peer relaying transactions that race recent-reject, orphan, and verification-queue state so `remove` in `tx-pool/src/component/links.rs` performs expensive or unsafe work before validation and pollute orphan/recent-reject/verification queues so one attacker consumes disproportionate resources, violating tx-pool admission must remain a safe prefilter for consensus block verification, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `tx-pool/src/component/links.rs::remove`
- Entrypoint: a peer relaying transactions that race recent-reject, orphan, and verification-queue state
- Attacker controls: block template limits, tx selection order, uncle candidates, proposal IDs, and fee estimator samples
- Exploit idea: pollute orphan/recent-reject/verification queues so one attacker consumes disproportionate resources
- Invariant to test: tx-pool admission must remain a safe prefilter for consensus block verification
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Simulate tx-pool submission, orphan/recent-reject transitions, and block-template assembly; assert bounded queues and consensus-valid output.

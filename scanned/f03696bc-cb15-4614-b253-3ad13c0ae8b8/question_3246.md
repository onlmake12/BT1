# Q3246: Critical transaction limit off by one in new_builder

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries through a script author referencing edge-case cells, headers, DAO data, and occupied-capacity values so `new_builder` in `util/types/src/core/hardfork/ckb2021.rs` create a state transition where capacity or spendability changes without a matching valid authorization, violating resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/core/hardfork/ckb2021.rs::new_builder`
- Entrypoint: a script author referencing edge-case cells, headers, DAO data, and occupied-capacity values
- Attacker controls: input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries
- Exploit idea: create a state transition where capacity or spendability changes without a matching valid authorization
- Invariant to test: resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

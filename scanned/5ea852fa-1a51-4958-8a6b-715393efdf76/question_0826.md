# Q826: High core canonical encoding ambiguity in store

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs through an unprivileged peer, RPC caller, or transaction sender reaching this shared module through production paths so `store` in `util/constant/src/store.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input, violating security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/constant/src/store.rs::store`
- Entrypoint: an unprivileged peer, RPC caller, or transaction sender reaching this shared module through production paths
- Attacker controls: message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs
- Exploit idea: trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input
- Invariant to test: security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

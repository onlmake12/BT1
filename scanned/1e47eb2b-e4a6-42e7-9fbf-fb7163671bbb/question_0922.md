# Q922: High core state transition mismatch in extension

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module and sequence conversion inputs, collection lengths, duplicate identifiers, empty values, and maximum-size payloads so `extension` in `util/gen-types/src/extension/mod.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers, violating caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `util/gen-types/src/extension/mod.rs::extension`
- Entrypoint: a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module
- Attacker controls: conversion inputs, collection lengths, duplicate identifiers, empty values, and maximum-size payloads
- Exploit idea: make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers
- Invariant to test: caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

# Q129: High cli limit off by one in adjust

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for runtime stop timing, spawned process handles, channel pressure, memory tracker samples, and data paths through a local process starting, stopping, importing, exporting, replaying, or migrating CKB data so `adjust` in `util/app-config/src/configs/db.rs` trigger an import/export/replay/migrate path to disagree with normal node validation or storage state, violating default-enabled configuration must preserve security, performance, and protocol assumptions, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/app-config/src/configs/db.rs::adjust`
- Entrypoint: a local process starting, stopping, importing, exporting, replaying, or migrating CKB data
- Attacker controls: runtime stop timing, spawned process handles, channel pressure, memory tracker samples, and data paths
- Exploit idea: trigger an import/export/replay/migrate path to disagree with normal node validation or storage state
- Invariant to test: default-enabled configuration must preserve security, performance, and protocol assumptions
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Run the supported CLI/config path in a temp directory with crafted local input; assert clean error, no state corruption, and bounded runtime.

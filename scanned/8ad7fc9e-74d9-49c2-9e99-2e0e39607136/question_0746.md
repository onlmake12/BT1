# Q746: High core restart reorg persistence in consensus

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior through a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates, then force normal restart, reorg, retry, or replay handling so `consensus` in `util/constant/src/consensus.rs` persists inconsistent state and trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input, violating security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/constant/src/consensus.rs::consensus`
- Entrypoint: a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates
- Attacker controls: local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior
- Exploit idea: trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input
- Invariant to test: security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

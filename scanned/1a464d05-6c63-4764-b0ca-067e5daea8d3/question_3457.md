# Q3457: High txpool limit off by one in get_parents

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for transaction fee, size, cycles, deps, ancestor/descendant graph, orphan parents, and proposal status through a local miner process selecting proposals and uncles near limit boundaries so `get_parents` in `tx-pool/src/component/links.rs` force quadratic graph or selection behavior with few low-cost transactions, violating pool, orphan, recent-reject, and verify-queue resource use must stay bounded under attacker submissions, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `tx-pool/src/component/links.rs::get_parents`
- Entrypoint: a local miner process selecting proposals and uncles near limit boundaries
- Attacker controls: transaction fee, size, cycles, deps, ancestor/descendant graph, orphan parents, and proposal status
- Exploit idea: force quadratic graph or selection behavior with few low-cost transactions
- Invariant to test: pool, orphan, recent-reject, and verify-queue resource use must stay bounded under attacker submissions
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Simulate tx-pool submission, orphan/recent-reject transitions, and block-template assembly; assert bounded queues and consensus-valid output.

# Q2264: Low rpc cross module inconsistency in EstimateCycles

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters to make `EstimateCycles` in `util/jsonrpc-types/src/experiment.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where amplify storage scans or proof generation with small crafted RPC requests, violating RPC submission paths must not bypass consensus, tx-pool, or block-template validation, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `util/jsonrpc-types/src/experiment.rs::EstimateCycles`
- Entrypoint: a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters
- Attacker controls: indexer state freshness, reorg timing, block-filter requests, and proof target positions
- Exploit idea: amplify storage scans or proof generation with small crafted RPC requests
- Invariant to test: RPC submission paths must not bypass consensus, tx-pool, or block-template validation
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.

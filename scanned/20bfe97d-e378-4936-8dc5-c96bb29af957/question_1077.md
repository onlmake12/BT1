# Q1077: High core resource amplification in Unpack

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior through a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data to make `Unpack` in `util/types/src/conversion/storage.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input, violating security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/conversion/storage.rs::Unpack`
- Entrypoint: a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data
- Attacker controls: local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior
- Exploit idea: trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input
- Invariant to test: security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

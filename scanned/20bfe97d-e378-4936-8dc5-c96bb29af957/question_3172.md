# Q3172: High transaction resource amplification in Default

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries through a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block to make `Default` in `util/types/src/core/advanced_builders.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and make dependency resolution use a different cell/header than the script-visible authorization path, violating tx-pool admission and block verification must not diverge for security-relevant validity, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/core/advanced_builders.rs::Default`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block
- Attacker controls: input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries
- Exploit idea: make dependency resolution use a different cell/header than the script-visible authorization path
- Invariant to test: tx-pool admission and block verification must not diverge for security-relevant validity
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

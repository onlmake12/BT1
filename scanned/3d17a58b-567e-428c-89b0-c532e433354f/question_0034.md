# Q34: Low cli cross module inconsistency in parse_from_to_arg

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use an operator-facing component processing log, metrics, memory, runtime, or launcher state to make `parse_from_to_arg` in `ckb-bin/src/subcommand/export.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where trigger an import/export/replay/migrate path to disagree with normal node validation or storage state, violating import/export/replay/migration behavior must match production validation and storage invariants, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `ckb-bin/src/subcommand/export.rs::parse_from_to_arg`
- Entrypoint: an operator-facing component processing log, metrics, memory, runtime, or launcher state
- Attacker controls: runtime stop timing, spawned process handles, channel pressure, memory tracker samples, and data paths
- Exploit idea: trigger an import/export/replay/migrate path to disagree with normal node validation or storage state
- Invariant to test: import/export/replay/migration behavior must match production validation and storage invariants
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Run the supported CLI/config path in a temp directory with crafted local input; assert clean error, no state corruption, and bounded runtime.

# Q612: Critical consensus resource amplification in From

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small header timestamp, compact target, epoch fraction, nonce, parent hash, and block number through an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects to make `From` in `verification/src/cache.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and trigger an arithmetic, encoding, or target-conversion edge before the normal consensus rejection path, violating all honest nodes must deterministically accept and reject the same blocks under the same consensus spec, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `verification/src/cache.rs::From`
- Entrypoint: an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects
- Attacker controls: header timestamp, compact target, epoch fraction, nonce, parent hash, and block number
- Exploit idea: trigger an arithmetic, encoding, or target-conversion edge before the normal consensus rejection path
- Invariant to test: all honest nodes must deterministically accept and reject the same blocks under the same consensus spec
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

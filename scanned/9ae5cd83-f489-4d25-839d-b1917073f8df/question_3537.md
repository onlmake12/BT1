# Q3537: High txpool resource amplification in handle_recv_error

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small duplicate hashes, conflicted inputs, dep-heavy packages, and repeated rejected submissions through a miner/RPC block-template caller assembling blocks from adversarial tx-pool state to make `handle_recv_error` in `tx-pool/src/error.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and pollute orphan/recent-reject/verification queues so one attacker consumes disproportionate resources, violating pool, orphan, recent-reject, and verify-queue resource use must stay bounded under attacker submissions, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `tx-pool/src/error.rs::handle_recv_error`
- Entrypoint: a miner/RPC block-template caller assembling blocks from adversarial tx-pool state
- Attacker controls: duplicate hashes, conflicted inputs, dep-heavy packages, and repeated rejected submissions
- Exploit idea: pollute orphan/recent-reject/verification queues so one attacker consumes disproportionate resources
- Invariant to test: pool, orphan, recent-reject, and verify-queue resource use must stay bounded under attacker submissions
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Simulate tx-pool submission, orphan/recent-reject transitions, and block-template assembly; assert bounded queues and consensus-valid output.

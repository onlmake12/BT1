# Q2587: Critical storage state transition mismatch in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an operator replay/import/restart after attacker-shaped blocks, transactions, or indexes were persisted and sequence block order, reorg depth, cell lifetimes, transaction metadata, header maps, and snapshot timing so `lib` in `shared/src/lib.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow trigger database/freezer/migration panic or unrecoverable state from attacker-shaped accepted data, violating database writes, freezer state, migrations, and snapshots must be atomic for security-relevant data, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `shared/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: an operator replay/import/restart after attacker-shaped blocks, transactions, or indexes were persisted
- Attacker controls: block order, reorg depth, cell lifetimes, transaction metadata, header maps, and snapshot timing
- Exploit idea: trigger database/freezer/migration panic or unrecoverable state from attacker-shaped accepted data
- Invariant to test: database writes, freezer state, migrations, and snapshots must be atomic for security-relevant data
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

# Q3198: Critical transaction resource amplification in is_live

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small canonical cell status before and after reorg, snapshot lookup results, and dep-group layout through a script author referencing edge-case cells, headers, DAO data, and occupied-capacity values to make `is_live` in `util/types/src/core/cell.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and make dependency resolution use a different cell/header than the script-visible authorization path, violating tx-pool admission and block verification must not diverge for security-relevant validity, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/core/cell.rs::is_live`
- Entrypoint: a script author referencing edge-case cells, headers, DAO data, and occupied-capacity values
- Attacker controls: canonical cell status before and after reorg, snapshot lookup results, and dep-group layout
- Exploit idea: make dependency resolution use a different cell/header than the script-visible authorization path
- Invariant to test: tx-pool admission and block verification must not diverge for security-relevant validity
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

# Q2316: High rpc cache invalidation failure in From

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters to alternate valid and invalid indexer state freshness, reorg timing, block-filter requests, and proof target positions so `From` in `util/jsonrpc-types/src/pool.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and return stale or inconsistent security-relevant state after reorg, restart, or concurrent indexing, violating local RPC APIs must validate all caller-controlled parameters and fail without process crash, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/jsonrpc-types/src/pool.rs::From`
- Entrypoint: a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters
- Attacker controls: indexer state freshness, reorg timing, block-filter requests, and proof target positions
- Exploit idea: return stale or inconsistent security-relevant state after reorg, restart, or concurrent indexing
- Invariant to test: local RPC APIs must validate all caller-controlled parameters and fail without process crash
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.

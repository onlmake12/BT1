# Q2200: High rpc cross module inconsistency in try_loop_sync

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters to make `try_loop_sync` in `util/indexer-sync/src/lib.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make RPC/indexer code panic or allocate heavily before validation clamps the request, violating proof, filter, and index queries must remain bounded and not expose stale security-relevant data, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/indexer-sync/src/lib.rs::try_loop_sync`
- Entrypoint: a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters
- Attacker controls: indexer state freshness, reorg timing, block-filter requests, and proof target positions
- Exploit idea: make RPC/indexer code panic or allocate heavily before validation clamps the request
- Invariant to test: proof, filter, and index queries must remain bounded and not expose stale security-relevant data
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.

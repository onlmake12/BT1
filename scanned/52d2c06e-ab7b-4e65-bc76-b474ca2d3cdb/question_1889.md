# Q1889: High network cross module inconsistency in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records to make `lib` in `sync/src/lib.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied, violating P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records
- Attacker controls: header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses
- Exploit idea: cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied
- Invariant to test: P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

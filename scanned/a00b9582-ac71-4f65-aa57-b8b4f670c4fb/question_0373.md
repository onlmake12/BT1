# Q373: Critical consensus restart reorg persistence in Drop

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape header timestamp, compact target, epoch fraction, nonce, parent hash, and block number through an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects, then force normal restart, reorg, retry, or replay handling so `Drop` in `chain/src/init.rs` persists inconsistent state and force two verification paths to classify the same block differently around a boundary check, violating malformed consensus objects must return structured errors without node panic or unbounded work, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/src/init.rs::Drop`
- Entrypoint: an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects
- Attacker controls: header timestamp, compact target, epoch fraction, nonce, parent hash, and block number
- Exploit idea: force two verification paths to classify the same block differently around a boundary check
- Invariant to test: malformed consensus objects must return structured errors without node panic or unbounded work
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

# Q3061: Critical transaction replay reorder race in CellData

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker replay, reorder, or delay canonical cell status before and after reorg, snapshot lookup results, and dep-group layout through a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block so `CellData` in `util/jsonrpc-types/src/cell.rs` takes a stale branch and make non-contextual, contextual, and tx-pool verification disagree about the same transaction, breaking the invariant that tx-pool admission and block verification must not diverge for security-relevant validity, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `util/jsonrpc-types/src/cell.rs::CellData`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block
- Attacker controls: canonical cell status before and after reorg, snapshot lookup results, and dep-group layout
- Exploit idea: make non-contextual, contextual, and tx-pool verification disagree about the same transaction
- Invariant to test: tx-pool admission and block verification must not diverge for security-relevant validity
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

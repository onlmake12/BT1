# Q1736: Critical network batch interaction bug in async_disconnect

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs through a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks so `async_disconnect` in `network/src/protocols/mod.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply, violating sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/protocols/mod.rs::async_disconnect`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks
- Attacker controls: compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs
- Exploit idea: desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply
- Invariant to test: sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

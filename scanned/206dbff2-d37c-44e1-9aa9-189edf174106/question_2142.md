# Q2142: High rpc limit off by one in get_cells_capacity

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for indexer state freshness, reorg timing, block-filter requests, and proof target positions through a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters so `get_cells_capacity` in `rpc/src/module/rich_indexer.rs` cause locally submitted blocks/transactions to enter a path with weaker validation than P2P relay, violating RPC/indexer/helper state must match canonical chain state after reorg, restart, and pagination, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc/src/module/rich_indexer.rs::get_cells_capacity`
- Entrypoint: a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters
- Attacker controls: indexer state freshness, reorg timing, block-filter requests, and proof target positions
- Exploit idea: cause locally submitted blocks/transactions to enter a path with weaker validation than P2P relay
- Invariant to test: RPC/indexer/helper state must match canonical chain state after reorg, restart, and pagination
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.

# Q535: Critical consensus state transition mismatch in complete_testnet

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects and sequence uncle lists, proposal IDs, block extension bytes, transaction roots, and DAO fields so `complete_testnet` in `spec/src/hardfork.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow make fork-choice or delayed verification commit a block whose derived roots or epoch data disagree with recalculation, violating fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `spec/src/hardfork.rs::complete_testnet`
- Entrypoint: an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects
- Attacker controls: uncle lists, proposal IDs, block extension bytes, transaction roots, and DAO fields
- Exploit idea: make fork-choice or delayed verification commit a block whose derived roots or epoch data disagree with recalculation
- Invariant to test: fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

# Q1098: High core cross module inconsistency in global

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data to make `global` in `util/types/src/global.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make canonical serialization or conversion accept an ambiguous representation, violating shared production helpers must be deterministic, bounded, and canonical for all security-relevant callers, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/global.rs::global`
- Entrypoint: a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data
- Attacker controls: serialized CKB objects, hashes, indexes, ranges, counts, options, and boundary numeric values
- Exploit idea: make canonical serialization or conversion accept an ambiguous representation
- Invariant to test: shared production helpers must be deterministic, bounded, and canonical for all security-relevant callers
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

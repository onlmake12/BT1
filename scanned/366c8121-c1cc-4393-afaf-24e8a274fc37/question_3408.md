# Q3408: Critical txpool batch interaction bug in notify

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch transaction fee, size, cycles, deps, ancestor/descendant graph, orphan parents, and proposal status through a local miner process selecting proposals and uncles near limit boundaries so `notify` in `tx-pool/src/block_assembler/mod.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and make tx-pool policy accept a transaction that block verification later rejects, or reject valid traffic cheaply, violating tx-pool admission must remain a safe prefilter for consensus block verification, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `tx-pool/src/block_assembler/mod.rs::notify`
- Entrypoint: a local miner process selecting proposals and uncles near limit boundaries
- Attacker controls: transaction fee, size, cycles, deps, ancestor/descendant graph, orphan parents, and proposal status
- Exploit idea: make tx-pool policy accept a transaction that block verification later rejects, or reject valid traffic cheaply
- Invariant to test: tx-pool admission must remain a safe prefilter for consensus block verification
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Simulate tx-pool submission, orphan/recent-reject transitions, and block-template assembly; assert bounded queues and consensus-valid output.

# Q361: Critical consensus resource amplification in ChainService

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small uncle lists, proposal IDs, block extension bytes, transaction roots, and DAO fields through an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects to make `ChainService` in `chain/src/chain_service.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and force two verification paths to classify the same block differently around a boundary check, violating invalid PoW, epoch, uncle, proposal, extension, DAO, or root data must never become canonical, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/src/chain_service.rs::ChainService`
- Entrypoint: an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects
- Attacker controls: uncle lists, proposal IDs, block extension bytes, transaction roots, and DAO fields
- Exploit idea: force two verification paths to classify the same block differently around a boundary check
- Invariant to test: invalid PoW, epoch, uncle, proposal, extension, DAO, or root data must never become canonical
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

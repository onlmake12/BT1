# Q3595: Critical txpool batch interaction bug in is_missing_input

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch duplicate hashes, conflicted inputs, dep-heavy packages, and repeated rejected submissions through a local miner process selecting proposals and uncles near limit boundaries so `is_missing_input` in `tx-pool/src/util.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and force quadratic graph or selection behavior with few low-cost transactions, violating pool, orphan, recent-reject, and verify-queue resource use must stay bounded under attacker submissions, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `tx-pool/src/util.rs::is_missing_input`
- Entrypoint: a local miner process selecting proposals and uncles near limit boundaries
- Attacker controls: duplicate hashes, conflicted inputs, dep-heavy packages, and repeated rejected submissions
- Exploit idea: force quadratic graph or selection behavior with few low-cost transactions
- Invariant to test: pool, orphan, recent-reject, and verify-queue resource use must stay bounded under attacker submissions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Simulate tx-pool submission, orphan/recent-reject transitions, and block-template assembly; assert bounded queues and consensus-valid output.

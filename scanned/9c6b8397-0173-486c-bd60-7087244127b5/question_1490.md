# Q1490: Critical network batch interaction bug in From

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses through a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages so `From` in `network/src/network_group.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse, violating peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/network_group.rs::From`
- Entrypoint: a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages
- Attacker controls: header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses
- Exploit idea: make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse
- Invariant to test: peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

# Q1798: High network state transition mismatch in Drop

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records and sequence message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths so `Drop` in `network/src/services/dump_peer_store.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload, violating P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/services/dump_peer_store.rs::Drop`
- Entrypoint: a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records
- Attacker controls: message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths
- Exploit idea: trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload
- Invariant to test: P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

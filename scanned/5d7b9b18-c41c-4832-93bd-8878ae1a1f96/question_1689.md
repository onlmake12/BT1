# Q1689: High network cross module inconsistency in forward_request

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads to make `forward_request` in `network/src/protocols/hole_punching/component/mod.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload, violating P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/protocols/hole_punching/component/mod.rs::forward_request`
- Entrypoint: a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads
- Attacker controls: compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs
- Exploit idea: trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload
- Invariant to test: P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

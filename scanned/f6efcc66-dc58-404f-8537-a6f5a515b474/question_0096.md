# Q96: Low cli limit off by one in file_system

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for TOML config values, resource templates, default directories, sentry/log/metrics settings, and process state through an operator using default-enabled configuration generated or parsed by the node so `file_system` in `resource/src/lib.rs` crash the command or node through supported local input before validation or recovery runs, violating supported local CLI and config paths must fail cleanly and not corrupt node state, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `resource/src/lib.rs::file_system`
- Entrypoint: an operator using default-enabled configuration generated or parsed by the node
- Attacker controls: TOML config values, resource templates, default directories, sentry/log/metrics settings, and process state
- Exploit idea: crash the command or node through supported local input before validation or recovery runs
- Invariant to test: supported local CLI and config paths must fail cleanly and not corrupt node state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Run the supported CLI/config path in a temp directory with crafted local input; assert clean error, no state corruption, and bounded runtime.

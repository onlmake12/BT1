# Q3200: High transaction cross module inconsistency in live_cell

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a tx-pool submitter racing mempool admission against chain reorg or cell status changes to make `live_cell` in `util/types/src/core/cell.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization, violating resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/core/cell.rs::live_cell`
- Entrypoint: a tx-pool submitter racing mempool admission against chain reorg or cell status changes
- Attacker controls: input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries
- Exploit idea: bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization
- Invariant to test: resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

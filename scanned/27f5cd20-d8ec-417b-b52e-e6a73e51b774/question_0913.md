# Q913: High core parser precheck gap in total_capacity

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit malformed-but-reachable local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior through a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module so `total_capacity` in `util/gen-types/src/extension/capacity.rs` performs expensive or unsafe work before validation and make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers, violating security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `util/gen-types/src/extension/capacity.rs::total_capacity`
- Entrypoint: a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module
- Attacker controls: local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior
- Exploit idea: make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers
- Invariant to test: security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

# Q2816: High storage canonical encoding ambiguity in Migration

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for database column contents derived from accepted blocks, freezer boundaries, migration versions, and write-batch size through a node receiving valid-looking blocks that stress snapshots, caches, freezer, and write batches so `Migration` in `util/migrate/src/migrations/add_number_hash_mapping.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and force large storage or lookup amplification with a small number of valid blocks or transactions, violating database writes, freezer state, migrations, and snapshots must be atomic for security-relevant data, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/migrate/src/migrations/add_number_hash_mapping.rs::Migration`
- Entrypoint: a node receiving valid-looking blocks that stress snapshots, caches, freezer, and write batches
- Attacker controls: database column contents derived from accepted blocks, freezer boundaries, migration versions, and write-batch size
- Exploit idea: force large storage or lookup amplification with a small number of valid blocks or transactions
- Invariant to test: database writes, freezer state, migrations, and snapshots must be atomic for security-relevant data
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

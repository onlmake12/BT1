# Q3512: Critical txpool resource amplification in ModifiedTx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small duplicate hashes, conflicted inputs, dep-heavy packages, and repeated rejected submissions through a transaction sender repeatedly submitting package, orphan, replacement, and low-fee transactions to make `ModifiedTx` in `tx-pool/src/component/tx_selector.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and pollute orphan/recent-reject/verification queues so one attacker consumes disproportionate resources, violating pool, orphan, recent-reject, and verify-queue resource use must stay bounded under attacker submissions, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `tx-pool/src/component/tx_selector.rs::ModifiedTx`
- Entrypoint: a transaction sender repeatedly submitting package, orphan, replacement, and low-fee transactions
- Attacker controls: duplicate hashes, conflicted inputs, dep-heavy packages, and repeated rejected submissions
- Exploit idea: pollute orphan/recent-reject/verification queues so one attacker consumes disproportionate resources
- Invariant to test: pool, orphan, recent-reject, and verify-queue resource use must stay bounded under attacker submissions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Simulate tx-pool submission, orphan/recent-reject transitions, and block-template assembly; assert bounded queues and consensus-valid output.

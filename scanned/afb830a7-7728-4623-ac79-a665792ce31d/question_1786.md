# Q1786: High network restart reorg persistence in SeedRecord

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs through a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages, then force normal restart, reorg, retry, or replay handling so `SeedRecord` in `network/src/services/dns_seeding/seed_record.rs` persists inconsistent state and cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied, violating sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/services/dns_seeding/seed_record.rs::SeedRecord`
- Entrypoint: a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages
- Attacker controls: compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs
- Exploit idea: cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied
- Invariant to test: sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

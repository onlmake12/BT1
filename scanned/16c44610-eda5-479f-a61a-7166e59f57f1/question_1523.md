# Q1523: Critical network canonical encoding ambiguity in fetch_random

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs through a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records so `fetch_random` in `network/src/peer_store/addr_manager.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied, violating P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/peer_store/addr_manager.rs::fetch_random`
- Entrypoint: a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records
- Attacker controls: compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs
- Exploit idea: cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied
- Invariant to test: P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

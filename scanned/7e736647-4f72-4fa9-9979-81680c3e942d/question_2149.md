# Q2149: Low rpc differential path split in get_deployments_info

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `get_deployments_info` in `rpc/src/module/stats.rs` through two production paths from a miner or wallet integration calling chain, pool, miner, net, debug, or subscription APIs and make one path accept while the other rejects because of block/template parameters, transaction payloads, fee-rate values, and debug/experiment options, violating proof, filter, and index queries must remain bounded and not expose stale security-relevant data, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc/src/module/stats.rs::get_deployments_info`
- Entrypoint: a miner or wallet integration calling chain, pool, miner, net, debug, or subscription APIs
- Attacker controls: block/template parameters, transaction payloads, fee-rate values, and debug/experiment options
- Exploit idea: cause locally submitted blocks/transactions to enter a path with weaker validation than P2P relay
- Invariant to test: proof, filter, and index queries must remain bounded and not expose stale security-relevant data
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.

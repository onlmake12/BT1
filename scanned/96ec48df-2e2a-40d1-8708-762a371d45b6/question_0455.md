# Q455: Critical consensus restart reorg persistence in new

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape uncle lists, proposal IDs, block extension bytes, transaction roots, and DAO fields through an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects, then force normal restart, reorg, retry, or replay handling so `new` in `chain/src/verify.rs` persists inconsistent state and trigger an arithmetic, encoding, or target-conversion edge before the normal consensus rejection path, violating invalid PoW, epoch, uncle, proposal, extension, DAO, or root data must never become canonical, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/src/verify.rs::new`
- Entrypoint: an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects
- Attacker controls: uncle lists, proposal IDs, block extension bytes, transaction roots, and DAO fields
- Exploit idea: trigger an arithmetic, encoding, or target-conversion edge before the normal consensus rejection path
- Invariant to test: invalid PoW, epoch, uncle, proposal, extension, DAO, or root data must never become canonical
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

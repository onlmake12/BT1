# Q2889: High transaction replay reorder race in new

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker replay, reorder, or delay input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries through a transaction sender submitting crafted inputs, outputs, deps, witnesses, and since values so `new` in `script/src/syscalls/load_cell_data.rs` takes a stale branch and bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization, breaking the invariant that resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/syscalls/load_cell_data.rs::new`
- Entrypoint: a transaction sender submitting crafted inputs, outputs, deps, witnesses, and since values
- Attacker controls: input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries
- Exploit idea: bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization
- Invariant to test: resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

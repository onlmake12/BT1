# Q1086: High core batch interaction bug in From

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch conversion inputs, collection lengths, duplicate identifiers, empty values, and maximum-size payloads through a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data so `From` in `util/types/src/conversion/utilities.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and make canonical serialization or conversion accept an ambiguous representation, violating caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/conversion/utilities.rs::From`
- Entrypoint: a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data
- Attacker controls: conversion inputs, collection lengths, duplicate identifiers, empty values, and maximum-size payloads
- Exploit idea: make canonical serialization or conversion accept an ambiguous representation
- Invariant to test: caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

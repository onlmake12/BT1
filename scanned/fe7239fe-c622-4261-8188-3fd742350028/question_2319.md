# Q2319: High rpc resource amplification in json_display

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small block/template parameters, transaction payloads, fee-rate values, and debug/experiment options through a miner or wallet integration calling chain, pool, miner, net, debug, or subscription APIs to make `json_display` in `util/jsonrpc-types/src/pool.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and return stale or inconsistent security-relevant state after reorg, restart, or concurrent indexing, violating RPC/indexer/helper state must match canonical chain state after reorg, restart, and pagination, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/jsonrpc-types/src/pool.rs::json_display`
- Entrypoint: a miner or wallet integration calling chain, pool, miner, net, debug, or subscription APIs
- Attacker controls: block/template parameters, transaction payloads, fee-rate values, and debug/experiment options
- Exploit idea: return stale or inconsistent security-relevant state after reorg, restart, or concurrent indexing
- Invariant to test: RPC/indexer/helper state must match canonical chain state after reorg, restart, and pagination
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.

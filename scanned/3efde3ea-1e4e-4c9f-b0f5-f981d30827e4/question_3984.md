# Q3984: High vm replay reorder race in groups

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker replay, reorder, or delay RISC-V bytecode, argv/env, witness bytes, syscall offsets, lengths, indexes, and source selectors through a script author invoking syscalls with boundary offsets, lengths, file descriptors, and process handles so `groups` in `script/src/verify.rs` takes a stale branch and undercharge cycles or bypass a failure path by racing spawn/exec/read/write state transitions, breaking the invariant that cycle accounting and process state must remain bounded and cannot be bypassed by crafted scripts, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/verify.rs::groups`
- Entrypoint: a script author invoking syscalls with boundary offsets, lengths, file descriptors, and process handles
- Attacker controls: RISC-V bytecode, argv/env, witness bytes, syscall offsets, lengths, indexes, and source selectors
- Exploit idea: undercharge cycles or bypass a failure path by racing spawn/exec/read/write state transitions
- Invariant to test: cycle accounting and process state must remain bounded and cannot be bypassed by crafted scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

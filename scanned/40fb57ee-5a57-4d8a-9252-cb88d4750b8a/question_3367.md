# Q3367: Critical txpool cross module inconsistency in poll_worker_message

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a peer relaying transactions that race recent-reject, orphan, and verification-queue state to make `poll_worker_message` in `miner/src/worker/dummy.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where pollute orphan/recent-reject/verification queues so one attacker consumes disproportionate resources, violating pool, orphan, recent-reject, and verify-queue resource use must stay bounded under attacker submissions, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `miner/src/worker/dummy.rs::poll_worker_message`
- Entrypoint: a peer relaying transactions that race recent-reject, orphan, and verification-queue state
- Attacker controls: block template limits, tx selection order, uncle candidates, proposal IDs, and fee estimator samples
- Exploit idea: pollute orphan/recent-reject/verification queues so one attacker consumes disproportionate resources
- Invariant to test: pool, orphan, recent-reject, and verify-queue resource use must stay bounded under attacker submissions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Simulate tx-pool submission, orphan/recent-reject transitions, and block-template assembly; assert bounded queues and consensus-valid output.

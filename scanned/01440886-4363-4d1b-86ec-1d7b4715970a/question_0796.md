# Q796: High core cache invalidation failure in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use an unprivileged peer, RPC caller, or transaction sender reaching this shared module through production paths to alternate valid and invalid message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs so `lib` in `util/constant/src/lib.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers, violating module-level assumptions must hold across consensus, network, RPC, storage, and tx-pool paths, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `util/constant/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: an unprivileged peer, RPC caller, or transaction sender reaching this shared module through production paths
- Attacker controls: message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs
- Exploit idea: make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers
- Invariant to test: module-level assumptions must hold across consensus, network, RPC, storage, and tx-pool paths
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

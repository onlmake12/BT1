# Q984: Low core limit off by one in new

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for conversion inputs, collection lengths, duplicate identifiers, empty values, and maximum-size payloads through a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates so `new` in `util/onion/src/onion_service.rs` break a resource bound or state transition that downstream modules assume is already enforced, violating module-level assumptions must hold across consensus, network, RPC, storage, and tx-pool paths, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `util/onion/src/onion_service.rs::new`
- Entrypoint: a block or transaction relayer triggering this helper during validation, sync, or storage updates
- Attacker controls: conversion inputs, collection lengths, duplicate identifiers, empty values, and maximum-size payloads
- Exploit idea: break a resource bound or state transition that downstream modules assume is already enforced
- Invariant to test: module-level assumptions must hold across consensus, network, RPC, storage, and tx-pool paths
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

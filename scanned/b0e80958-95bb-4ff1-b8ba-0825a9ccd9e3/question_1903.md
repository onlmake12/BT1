# Q1903: High network differential path split in median_offset

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `median_offset` in `sync/src/net_time_checker.rs` through two production paths from a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages and make one path accept while the other rejects because of peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing, violating malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/net_time_checker.rs::median_offset`
- Entrypoint: a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages
- Attacker controls: peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing
- Exploit idea: make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse
- Invariant to test: malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

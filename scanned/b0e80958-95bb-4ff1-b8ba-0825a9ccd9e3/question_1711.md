# Q1711: High network restart reorg persistence in code

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs through a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks, then force normal restart, reorg, retry, or replay handling so `code` in `network/src/protocols/hole_punching/status.rs` persists inconsistent state and make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse, violating peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/protocols/hole_punching/status.rs::code`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks
- Attacker controls: compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs
- Exploit idea: make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse
- Invariant to test: peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

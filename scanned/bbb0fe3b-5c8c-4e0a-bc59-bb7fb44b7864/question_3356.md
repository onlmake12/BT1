# Q3356: Critical txpool cross module inconsistency in notify_workers

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a peer relaying transactions that race recent-reject, orphan, and verification-queue state to make `notify_workers` in `miner/src/miner.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make tx-pool policy accept a transaction that block verification later rejects, or reject valid traffic cheaply, violating tx-pool admission must remain a safe prefilter for consensus block verification, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `miner/src/miner.rs::notify_workers`
- Entrypoint: a peer relaying transactions that race recent-reject, orphan, and verification-queue state
- Attacker controls: transaction fee, size, cycles, deps, ancestor/descendant graph, orphan parents, and proposal status
- Exploit idea: make tx-pool policy accept a transaction that block verification later rejects, or reject valid traffic cheaply
- Invariant to test: tx-pool admission must remain a safe prefilter for consensus block verification
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Simulate tx-pool submission, orphan/recent-reject transitions, and block-template assembly; assert bounded queues and consensus-valid output.

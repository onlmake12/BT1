# Q2854: Critical storage batch interaction bug in consensus

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch index keys, number-hash mappings, cell status transitions, and restart timing through a sync peer causing repeated rollback, truncation, migration, or state lookup edge cases so `consensus` in `util/snapshot/src/lib.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and trigger database/freezer/migration panic or unrecoverable state from attacker-shaped accepted data, violating state storage mechanisms must not allow cheap corruption, excessive growth, or crash-on-restart, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `util/snapshot/src/lib.rs::consensus`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer causing repeated rollback, truncation, migration, or state lookup edge cases
- Attacker controls: index keys, number-hash mappings, cell status transitions, and restart timing
- Exploit idea: trigger database/freezer/migration panic or unrecoverable state from attacker-shaped accepted data
- Invariant to test: state storage mechanisms must not allow cheap corruption, excessive growth, or crash-on-restart
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

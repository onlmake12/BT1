# Q2978: Critical transaction resource amplification in load_cell_data

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries through a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block to make `load_cell_data` in `traits/src/cell_data_provider.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and make non-contextual, contextual, and tx-pool verification disagree about the same transaction, violating tx-pool admission and block verification must not diverge for security-relevant validity, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `traits/src/cell_data_provider.rs::load_cell_data`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block
- Attacker controls: input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries
- Exploit idea: make non-contextual, contextual, and tx-pool verification disagree about the same transaction
- Invariant to test: tx-pool admission and block verification must not diverge for security-relevant validity
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

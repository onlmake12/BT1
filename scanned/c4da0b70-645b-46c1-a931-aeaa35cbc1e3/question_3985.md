# Q3985: High vm batch interaction bug in hash

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch spawn/exec metadata, pipe/read/write order, inherited fds, process IDs, and wait/close timing through a transaction sender deploying a crafted CKB-VM script and witness payload so `hash` in `script/src/verify.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and make a syscall expose bytes that differ from consensus-resolved transaction data, violating cycle accounting and process state must remain bounded and cannot be bypassed by crafted scripts, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/verify.rs::hash`
- Entrypoint: a transaction sender deploying a crafted CKB-VM script and witness payload
- Attacker controls: spawn/exec metadata, pipe/read/write order, inherited fds, process IDs, and wait/close timing
- Exploit idea: make a syscall expose bytes that differ from consensus-resolved transaction data
- Invariant to test: cycle accounting and process state must remain bounded and cannot be bypassed by crafted scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

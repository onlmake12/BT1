# Q1467: High network cross module inconsistency in observe_listen_port_occupancy

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages to make `observe_listen_port_occupancy` in `network/src/lib.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse, violating malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/lib.rs::observe_listen_port_occupancy`
- Entrypoint: a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages
- Attacker controls: peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing
- Exploit idea: make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse
- Invariant to test: malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

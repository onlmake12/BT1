# Q3347: Critical txpool cross module inconsistency in Work

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a local miner process selecting proposals and uncles near limit boundaries to make `Work` in `miner/src/lib.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make block assembly include invalid, duplicate, or economically wrong transactions or rewards, violating pool, orphan, recent-reject, and verify-queue resource use must stay bounded under attacker submissions, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `miner/src/lib.rs::Work`
- Entrypoint: a local miner process selecting proposals and uncles near limit boundaries
- Attacker controls: duplicate hashes, conflicted inputs, dep-heavy packages, and repeated rejected submissions
- Exploit idea: make block assembly include invalid, duplicate, or economically wrong transactions or rewards
- Invariant to test: pool, orphan, recent-reject, and verify-queue resource use must stay bounded under attacker submissions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Simulate tx-pool submission, orphan/recent-reject transitions, and block-template assembly; assert bounded queues and consensus-valid output.

# Q3825: High vm limit off by one in Syscalls

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for cycle limits, VM version, script hash type, loaded cell/header/tx/block-extension data through a malicious script spawning or execing child processes with adversarial inherited descriptors and pipes so `Syscalls` in `script/src/syscalls/load_script.rs` make a syscall expose bytes that differ from consensus-resolved transaction data, violating scripts must see exactly the resolved cells, headers, witnesses, and block extensions committed by consensus, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/syscalls/load_script.rs::Syscalls`
- Entrypoint: a malicious script spawning or execing child processes with adversarial inherited descriptors and pipes
- Attacker controls: cycle limits, VM version, script hash type, loaded cell/header/tx/block-extension data
- Exploit idea: make a syscall expose bytes that differ from consensus-resolved transaction data
- Invariant to test: scripts must see exactly the resolved cells, headers, witnesses, and block extensions committed by consensus
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

# Q967: Low core limit off by one in pack

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs through a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data so `pack` in `util/gen-types/src/prelude.rs` make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers, violating module-level assumptions must hold across consensus, network, RPC, storage, and tx-pool paths, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `util/gen-types/src/prelude.rs::pack`
- Entrypoint: a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data
- Attacker controls: message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs
- Exploit idea: make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers
- Invariant to test: module-level assumptions must hold across consensus, network, RPC, storage, and tx-pool paths
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

# Q2862: Critical transaction cross module inconsistency in RocksDBTransactionSnapshot

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a tx-pool submitter racing mempool admission against chain reorg or cell status changes to make `RocksDBTransactionSnapshot` in `db/src/transaction.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization, violating tx-pool admission and block verification must not diverge for security-relevant validity, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `db/src/transaction.rs::RocksDBTransactionSnapshot`
- Entrypoint: a tx-pool submitter racing mempool admission against chain reorg or cell status changes
- Attacker controls: maturity height, since flags, DAO fields, resolved transaction data, and duplicate dependencies
- Exploit idea: bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization
- Invariant to test: tx-pool admission and block verification must not diverge for security-relevant validity
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

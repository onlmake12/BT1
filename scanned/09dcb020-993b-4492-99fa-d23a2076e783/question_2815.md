# Q2815: High storage batch interaction bug in Migration

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch cache pressure, rollback order, canonical/forked block alternation, and missing extension/filter data through an operator replay/import/restart after attacker-shaped blocks, transactions, or indexes were persisted so `Migration` in `util/migrate/src/migrations/add_number_hash_mapping.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and make persisted state disagree with canonical verification state after restart or rollback, violating persisted CKB state must remain canonical, recoverable, and internally consistent across reorg/restart, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/migrate/src/migrations/add_number_hash_mapping.rs::Migration`
- Entrypoint: an operator replay/import/restart after attacker-shaped blocks, transactions, or indexes were persisted
- Attacker controls: cache pressure, rollback order, canonical/forked block alternation, and missing extension/filter data
- Exploit idea: make persisted state disagree with canonical verification state after restart or rollback
- Invariant to test: persisted CKB state must remain canonical, recoverable, and internally consistent across reorg/restart
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

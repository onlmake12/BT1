# Q514: Critical consensus cross module inconsistency in cellbase_maturity

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a miner on a private chain producing valid-PoW boundary blocks to make `cellbase_maturity` in `spec/src/consensus.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where trigger an arithmetic, encoding, or target-conversion edge before the normal consensus rejection path, violating invalid PoW, epoch, uncle, proposal, extension, DAO, or root data must never become canonical, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `spec/src/consensus.rs::cellbase_maturity`
- Entrypoint: a miner on a private chain producing valid-PoW boundary blocks
- Attacker controls: genesis/spec fields on a private chain and canonical block metadata during replay
- Exploit idea: trigger an arithmetic, encoding, or target-conversion edge before the normal consensus rejection path
- Invariant to test: invalid PoW, epoch, uncle, proposal, extension, DAO, or root data must never become canonical
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

# Q1492: High network state transition mismatch in Group

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads and sequence message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths so `Group` in `network/src/network_group.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply, violating P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/network_group.rs::Group`
- Entrypoint: a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads
- Attacker controls: message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths
- Exploit idea: desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply
- Invariant to test: P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

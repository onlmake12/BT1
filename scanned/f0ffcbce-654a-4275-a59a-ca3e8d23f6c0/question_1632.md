# Q1632: High network boundary divergence in decode

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks and use compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs to drive `decode` in `network/src/protocols/discovery/protocol.rs` across a boundary where cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied, violating the invariant that sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/protocols/discovery/protocol.rs::decode`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks
- Attacker controls: compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs
- Exploit idea: cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied
- Invariant to test: sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

# Q3626: Critical txpool cross module inconsistency in Error

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a transaction sender repeatedly submitting package, orphan, replacement, and low-fee transactions to make `Error` in `util/fee-estimator/src/error.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where pollute orphan/recent-reject/verification queues so one attacker consumes disproportionate resources, violating valid user transactions must not be persistently censored by cheap attacker-created pool state, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `util/fee-estimator/src/error.rs::Error`
- Entrypoint: a transaction sender repeatedly submitting package, orphan, replacement, and low-fee transactions
- Attacker controls: transaction fee, size, cycles, deps, ancestor/descendant graph, orphan parents, and proposal status
- Exploit idea: pollute orphan/recent-reject/verification queues so one attacker consumes disproportionate resources
- Invariant to test: valid user transactions must not be persistently censored by cheap attacker-created pool state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Simulate tx-pool submission, orphan/recent-reject transitions, and block-template assembly; assert bounded queues and consensus-valid output.

# Q2581: Medium storage differential path split in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `lib` in `shared/src/lib.rs` through two production paths from a peer-driven chain/reorg sequence that writes adversarial canonical and fork state and make one path accept while the other rejects because of index keys, number-hash mappings, cell status transitions, and restart timing, violating database writes, freezer state, migrations, and snapshots must be atomic for security-relevant data, causing Medium (2001 - 10000 points). Suboptimal implementation of CKB state storage mechanism?

## Target
- File/function: `shared/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a peer-driven chain/reorg sequence that writes adversarial canonical and fork state
- Attacker controls: index keys, number-hash mappings, cell status transitions, and restart timing
- Exploit idea: trigger database/freezer/migration panic or unrecoverable state from attacker-shaped accepted data
- Invariant to test: database writes, freezer state, migrations, and snapshots must be atomic for security-relevant data
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium (2001 - 10000 points). Suboptimal implementation of CKB state storage mechanism
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

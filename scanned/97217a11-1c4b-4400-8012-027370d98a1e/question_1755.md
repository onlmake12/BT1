# Q1755: Critical network cache invalidation failure in received

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks to alternate valid and invalid header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses so `received` in `network/src/protocols/ping.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied, violating sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/protocols/ping.rs::received`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks
- Attacker controls: header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses
- Exploit idea: cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied
- Invariant to test: sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

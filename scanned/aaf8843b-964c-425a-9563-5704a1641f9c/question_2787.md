# Q2787: Critical storage cross module inconsistency in migrate

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a peer-driven chain/reorg sequence that writes adversarial canonical and fork state to make `migrate` in `util/migrate/src/migrations/add_block_filter_hash.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where trigger database/freezer/migration panic or unrecoverable state from attacker-shaped accepted data, violating database writes, freezer state, migrations, and snapshots must be atomic for security-relevant data, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `util/migrate/src/migrations/add_block_filter_hash.rs::migrate`
- Entrypoint: a peer-driven chain/reorg sequence that writes adversarial canonical and fork state
- Attacker controls: block order, reorg depth, cell lifetimes, transaction metadata, header maps, and snapshot timing
- Exploit idea: trigger database/freezer/migration panic or unrecoverable state from attacker-shaped accepted data
- Invariant to test: database writes, freezer state, migrations, and snapshots must be atomic for security-relevant data
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

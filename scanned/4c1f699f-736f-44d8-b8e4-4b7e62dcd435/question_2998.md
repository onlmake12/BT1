# Q2998: Critical transaction limit off by one in get_block_extension

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for cell deps, header deps, witnesses, lock/type args, output data lengths, and capacity values through a tx-pool submitter racing mempool admission against chain reorg or cell status changes so `get_block_extension` in `traits/src/extension_provider.rs` make non-contextual, contextual, and tx-pool verification disagree about the same transaction, violating resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `traits/src/extension_provider.rs::get_block_extension`
- Entrypoint: a tx-pool submitter racing mempool admission against chain reorg or cell status changes
- Attacker controls: cell deps, header deps, witnesses, lock/type args, output data lengths, and capacity values
- Exploit idea: make non-contextual, contextual, and tx-pool verification disagree about the same transaction
- Invariant to test: resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

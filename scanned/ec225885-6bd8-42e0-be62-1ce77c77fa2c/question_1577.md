# Q1577: Critical network canonical encoding ambiguity in addr_manager

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses through a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks so `addr_manager` in `network/src/peer_store/peer_store_impl.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload, violating P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/peer_store/peer_store_impl.rs::addr_manager`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks
- Attacker controls: header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses
- Exploit idea: trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload
- Invariant to test: P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

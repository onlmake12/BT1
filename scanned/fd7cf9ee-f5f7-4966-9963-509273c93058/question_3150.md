# Q3150: High transaction restart reorg persistence in get_cells

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape cell deps, header deps, witnesses, lock/type args, output data lengths, and capacity values through a transaction sender submitting crafted inputs, outputs, deps, witnesses, and since values, then force normal restart, reorg, retry, or replay handling so `get_cells` in `util/rich-indexer/src/indexer_handle/async_indexer_handle/get_cells.rs` persists inconsistent state and make dependency resolution use a different cell/header than the script-visible authorization path, violating resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `util/rich-indexer/src/indexer_handle/async_indexer_handle/get_cells.rs::get_cells`
- Entrypoint: a transaction sender submitting crafted inputs, outputs, deps, witnesses, and since values
- Attacker controls: cell deps, header deps, witnesses, lock/type args, output data lengths, and capacity values
- Exploit idea: make dependency resolution use a different cell/header than the script-visible authorization path
- Invariant to test: resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

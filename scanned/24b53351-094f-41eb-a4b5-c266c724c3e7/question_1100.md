# Q1100: Low core parser precheck gap in global

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit malformed-but-reachable local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior through a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data so `global` in `util/types/src/global.rs` performs expensive or unsafe work before validation and make canonical serialization or conversion accept an ambiguous representation, violating module-level assumptions must hold across consensus, network, RPC, storage, and tx-pool paths, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/global.rs::global`
- Entrypoint: a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data
- Attacker controls: local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior
- Exploit idea: make canonical serialization or conversion accept an ambiguous representation
- Invariant to test: module-level assumptions must hold across consensus, network, RPC, storage, and tx-pool paths
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

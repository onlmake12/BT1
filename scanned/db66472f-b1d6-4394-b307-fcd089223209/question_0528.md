# Q528: Critical consensus canonical encoding ambiguity in SpecError

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for uncle lists, proposal IDs, block extension bytes, transaction roots, and DAO fields through an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects so `SpecError` in `spec/src/error.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and make contextual verification consume stale parent or epoch state after a reorg/orphan transition, violating fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `spec/src/error.rs::SpecError`
- Entrypoint: an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects
- Attacker controls: uncle lists, proposal IDs, block extension bytes, transaction roots, and DAO fields
- Exploit idea: make contextual verification consume stale parent or epoch state after a reorg/orphan transition
- Invariant to test: fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

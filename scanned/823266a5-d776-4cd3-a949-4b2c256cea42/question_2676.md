# Q2676: High storage cross module inconsistency in default

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a sync peer causing repeated rollback, truncation, migration, or state lookup edge cases to make `default` in `store/src/cache.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make persisted state disagree with canonical verification state after restart or rollback, violating state storage mechanisms must not allow cheap corruption, excessive growth, or crash-on-restart, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `store/src/cache.rs::default`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer causing repeated rollback, truncation, migration, or state lookup edge cases
- Attacker controls: block order, reorg depth, cell lifetimes, transaction metadata, header maps, and snapshot timing
- Exploit idea: make persisted state disagree with canonical verification state after restart or rollback
- Invariant to test: state storage mechanisms must not allow cheap corruption, excessive growth, or crash-on-restart
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a temp database with accepted blocks plus rollback/restart/replay; assert cell/header/index state matches canonical verification.

# Q1414: High crypto cross module inconsistency in verify_signatures

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a transaction sender supplying crafted signatures, hashes, script args, and witness data to make `verify_signatures` in `util/network-alert/src/verifier.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where panic or overrun a cryptographic parser before a malformed object is rejected, violating malformed signatures, proofs, alerts, or hashes must never crash a node or bypass authorization, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `util/network-alert/src/verifier.rs::verify_signatures`
- Entrypoint: a transaction sender supplying crafted signatures, hashes, script args, and witness data
- Attacker controls: script args, witness lock fields, pubkey hash matching, and conversion boundaries
- Exploit idea: panic or overrun a cryptographic parser before a malformed object is rejected
- Invariant to test: malformed signatures, proofs, alerts, or hashes must never crash a node or bypass authorization
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Add a property or unit test over signatures, hashes, proofs, and encodings; assert malformed variants reject without panic.

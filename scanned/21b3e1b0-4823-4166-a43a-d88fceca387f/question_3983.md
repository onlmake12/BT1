# Q3983: Critical vm limit off by one in complete

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for cycle limits, VM version, script hash type, loaded cell/header/tx/block-extension data through a block relayer executing transactions at VM-version or hardfork activation boundaries so `complete` in `script/src/verify.rs` undercharge cycles or bypass a failure path by racing spawn/exec/read/write state transitions, violating malformed syscall arguments must fail safely without node crash or authorization bypass, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/verify.rs::complete`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer executing transactions at VM-version or hardfork activation boundaries
- Attacker controls: cycle limits, VM version, script hash type, loaded cell/header/tx/block-extension data
- Exploit idea: undercharge cycles or bypass a failure path by racing spawn/exec/read/write state transitions
- Invariant to test: malformed syscall arguments must fail safely without node crash or authorization bypass
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

# Q972: High core cross module inconsistency in OnionServiceConfig

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module to make `OnionServiceConfig` in `util/onion/src/lib.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input, violating security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `util/onion/src/lib.rs::OnionServiceConfig`
- Entrypoint: a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module
- Attacker controls: serialized CKB objects, hashes, indexes, ranges, counts, options, and boundary numeric values
- Exploit idea: trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input
- Invariant to test: security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

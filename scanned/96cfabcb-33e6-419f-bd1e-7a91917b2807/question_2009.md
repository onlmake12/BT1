# Q2009: High network cache invalidation failure in execute

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads to alternate valid and invalid header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses so `execute` in `sync/src/synchronizer/get_headers_process.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply, violating P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/synchronizer/get_headers_process.rs::execute`
- Entrypoint: a transaction/block relayer sending repeated malformed-but-cheap payloads
- Attacker controls: header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses
- Exploit idea: desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply
- Invariant to test: P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

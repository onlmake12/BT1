# Q797: High core parser precheck gap in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit malformed-but-reachable message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs through a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data so `lib` in `util/constant/src/lib.rs` performs expensive or unsafe work before validation and make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers, violating module-level assumptions must hold across consensus, network, RPC, storage, and tx-pool paths, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/constant/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data
- Attacker controls: message order, retry timing, reorg state, cache pressure, and malformed but well-typed inputs
- Exploit idea: make a shared helper produce different results for consensus, RPC, storage, and tx-pool callers
- Invariant to test: module-level assumptions must hold across consensus, network, RPC, storage, and tx-pool paths
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

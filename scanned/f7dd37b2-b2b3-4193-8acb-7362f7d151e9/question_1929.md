# Q1929: High network cache invalidation failure in CompactBlockProcess

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks to alternate valid and invalid message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths so `CompactBlockProcess` in `sync/src/relayer/compact_block_process.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse, violating peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/relayer/compact_block_process.rs::CompactBlockProcess`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks
- Attacker controls: message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths
- Exploit idea: make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse
- Invariant to test: peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

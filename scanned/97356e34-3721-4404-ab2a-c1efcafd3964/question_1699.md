# Q1699: High network cache invalidation failure in connected

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages to alternate valid and invalid message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths so `connected` in `network/src/protocols/hole_punching/mod.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse, violating malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/protocols/hole_punching/mod.rs::connected`
- Entrypoint: a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages
- Attacker controls: message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths
- Exploit idea: make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse
- Invariant to test: malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

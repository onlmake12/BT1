# Q399: Critical consensus parser precheck gap in new

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit malformed-but-reachable fork order, orphan arrival timing, hardfork activation boundary, and reorg depth through a miner on a private chain producing valid-PoW boundary blocks so `new` in `chain/src/lib.rs` performs expensive or unsafe work before validation and make contextual verification consume stale parent or epoch state after a reorg/orphan transition, violating invalid PoW, epoch, uncle, proposal, extension, DAO, or root data must never become canonical, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/src/lib.rs::new`
- Entrypoint: a miner on a private chain producing valid-PoW boundary blocks
- Attacker controls: fork order, orphan arrival timing, hardfork activation boundary, and reorg depth
- Exploit idea: make contextual verification consume stale parent or epoch state after a reorg/orphan transition
- Invariant to test: invalid PoW, epoch, uncle, proposal, extension, DAO, or root data must never become canonical
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

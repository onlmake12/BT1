# Q1303: High crypto differential path split in hash

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `hash` in `util/fixed-hash/core/src/std_hash.rs` through two production paths from a peer relaying network alerts or consensus objects with adversarial cryptographic encodings and make one path accept while the other rejects because of script args, witness lock fields, pubkey hash matching, and conversion boundaries, violating malformed signatures, proofs, alerts, or hashes must never crash a node or bypass authorization, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `util/fixed-hash/core/src/std_hash.rs::hash`
- Entrypoint: a peer relaying network alerts or consensus objects with adversarial cryptographic encodings
- Attacker controls: script args, witness lock fields, pubkey hash matching, and conversion boundaries
- Exploit idea: make verification accept a malformed signature/proof/hash that should be rejected
- Invariant to test: malformed signatures, proofs, alerts, or hashes must never crash a node or bypass authorization
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Add a property or unit test over signatures, hashes, proofs, and encodings; assert malformed variants reject without panic.

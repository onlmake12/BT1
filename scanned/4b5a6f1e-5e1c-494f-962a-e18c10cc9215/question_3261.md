# Q3261: Critical transaction limit off by one in $name_struct

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for cell deps, header deps, witnesses, lock/type args, output data lengths, and capacity values through a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block so `$name_struct` in `util/types/src/core/hardfork/helper.rs` make dependency resolution use a different cell/header than the script-visible authorization path, violating capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/core/hardfork/helper.rs::$name_struct`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block
- Attacker controls: cell deps, header deps, witnesses, lock/type args, output data lengths, and capacity values
- Exploit idea: make dependency resolution use a different cell/header than the script-visible authorization path
- Invariant to test: capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

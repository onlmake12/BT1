# Q1364: Critical crypto canonical encoding ambiguity in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for Merkle leaves, proof ordering, duplicate hashes, empty roots, and MMR positions through a transaction sender supplying crafted signatures, hashes, script args, and witness data so `lib` in `util/multisig/src/lib.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and make verification accept a malformed signature/proof/hash that should be rejected, violating cryptographic checks must bind exactly to the intended message, domain, key, threshold, and serialized bytes, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `util/multisig/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a transaction sender supplying crafted signatures, hashes, script args, and witness data
- Attacker controls: Merkle leaves, proof ordering, duplicate hashes, empty roots, and MMR positions
- Exploit idea: make verification accept a malformed signature/proof/hash that should be rejected
- Invariant to test: cryptographic checks must bind exactly to the intended message, domain, key, threshold, and serialized bytes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Add a property or unit test over signatures, hashes, proofs, and encodings; assert malformed variants reject without panic.

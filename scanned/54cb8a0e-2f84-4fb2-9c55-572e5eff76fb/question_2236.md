# Q2236: High rpc resource amplification in Alert

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small RPC batch size, malformed hex/bytes, pagination direction, filter shape, and repeated polling cadence through a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters to make `Alert` in `util/jsonrpc-types/src/alert.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and amplify storage scans or proof generation with small crafted RPC requests, violating proof, filter, and index queries must remain bounded and not expose stale security-relevant data, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/jsonrpc-types/src/alert.rs::Alert`
- Entrypoint: a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters
- Attacker controls: RPC batch size, malformed hex/bytes, pagination direction, filter shape, and repeated polling cadence
- Exploit idea: amplify storage scans or proof generation with small crafted RPC requests
- Invariant to test: proof, filter, and index queries must remain bounded and not expose stale security-relevant data
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.

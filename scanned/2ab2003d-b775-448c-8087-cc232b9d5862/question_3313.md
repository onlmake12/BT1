# Q3313: High transaction batch interaction bug in get_transaction_weight

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch cell deps, header deps, witnesses, lock/type args, output data lengths, and capacity values through a script author referencing edge-case cells, headers, DAO data, and occupied-capacity values so `get_transaction_weight` in `util/types/src/core/tx_pool.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization, violating capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/core/tx_pool.rs::get_transaction_weight`
- Entrypoint: a script author referencing edge-case cells, headers, DAO data, and occupied-capacity values
- Attacker controls: cell deps, header deps, witnesses, lock/type args, output data lengths, and capacity values
- Exploit idea: bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization
- Invariant to test: capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

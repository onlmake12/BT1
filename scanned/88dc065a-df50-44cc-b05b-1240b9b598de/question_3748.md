# Q3748: High vm resource amplification in initialize

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small cycle limits, VM version, script hash type, loaded cell/header/tx/block-extension data through a script author invoking syscalls with boundary offsets, lengths, file descriptors, and process handles to make `initialize` in `script/src/syscalls/debugger.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and undercharge cycles or bypass a failure path by racing spawn/exec/read/write state transitions, violating scripts must see exactly the resolved cells, headers, witnesses, and block extensions committed by consensus, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/syscalls/debugger.rs::initialize`
- Entrypoint: a script author invoking syscalls with boundary offsets, lengths, file descriptors, and process handles
- Attacker controls: cycle limits, VM version, script hash type, loaded cell/header/tx/block-extension data
- Exploit idea: undercharge cycles or bypass a failure path by racing spawn/exec/read/write state transitions
- Invariant to test: scripts must see exactly the resolved cells, headers, witnesses, and block extensions committed by consensus
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

# Q1451: Critical network batch interaction bug in from_compressed

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses through a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks so `from_compressed` in `network/src/compress.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied, violating P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/compress.rs::from_compressed`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks
- Attacker controls: header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses
- Exploit idea: cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied
- Invariant to test: P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

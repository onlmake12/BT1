# Q3713: Critical vm cross module inconsistency in iterate_prepare_machine

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a malicious script spawning or execing child processes with adversarial inherited descriptors and pipes to make `iterate_prepare_machine` in `script/src/scheduler.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where undercharge cycles or bypass a failure path by racing spawn/exec/read/write state transitions, violating CKB-VM and syscall behavior must be deterministic and consensus-equivalent across nodes, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/scheduler.rs::iterate_prepare_machine`
- Entrypoint: a malicious script spawning or execing child processes with adversarial inherited descriptors and pipes
- Attacker controls: cycle limits, VM version, script hash type, loaded cell/header/tx/block-extension data
- Exploit idea: undercharge cycles or bypass a failure path by racing spawn/exec/read/write state transitions
- Invariant to test: CKB-VM and syscall behavior must be deterministic and consensus-equivalent across nodes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

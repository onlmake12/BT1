# Q1450: High network batch interaction bug in decode

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths through a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages so `decode` in `network/src/compress.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply, violating P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/compress.rs::decode`
- Entrypoint: a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages
- Attacker controls: message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths
- Exploit idea: desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply
- Invariant to test: P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

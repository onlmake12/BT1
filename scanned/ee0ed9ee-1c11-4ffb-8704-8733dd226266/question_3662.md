# Q3662: Critical txpool batch interaction bug in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch transaction fee, size, cycles, deps, ancestor/descendant graph, orphan parents, and proposal status through a transaction sender repeatedly submitting package, orphan, replacement, and low-fee transactions so `lib` in `util/fee-estimator/src/lib.rs` handles the first item safely but applies incorrect assumptions to later items and pollute orphan/recent-reject/verification queues so one attacker consumes disproportionate resources, violating block assembly must preserve consensus validity, proposal eligibility, reward, and fee accounting, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `util/fee-estimator/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a transaction sender repeatedly submitting package, orphan, replacement, and low-fee transactions
- Attacker controls: transaction fee, size, cycles, deps, ancestor/descendant graph, orphan parents, and proposal status
- Exploit idea: pollute orphan/recent-reject/verification queues so one attacker consumes disproportionate resources
- Invariant to test: block assembly must preserve consensus validity, proposal eligibility, reward, and fee accounting
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Simulate tx-pool submission, orphan/recent-reject transitions, and block-template assembly; assert bounded queues and consensus-valid output.

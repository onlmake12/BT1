# Q669: High consensus cross module inconsistency in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a sync peer delivering reordered headers, uncles, and block extensions to make `lib` in `verification/src/lib.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make contextual verification consume stale parent or epoch state after a reorg/orphan transition, violating fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `verification/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering reordered headers, uncles, and block extensions
- Attacker controls: genesis/spec fields on a private chain and canonical block metadata during replay
- Exploit idea: make contextual verification consume stale parent or epoch state after a reorg/orphan transition
- Invariant to test: fork choice and verification caches must remain consistent across reorg, restart, and delayed verification
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

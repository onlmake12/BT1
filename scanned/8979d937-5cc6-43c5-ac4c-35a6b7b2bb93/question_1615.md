# Q1615: High network canonical encoding ambiguity in register

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs through a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages so `register` in `network/src/protocols/discovery/addr.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse, violating peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/protocols/discovery/addr.rs::register`
- Entrypoint: a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages
- Attacker controls: compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs
- Exploit idea: make peer-store, ban, or discovery state degrade across restart and enable repeated cheap abuse
- Invariant to test: peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

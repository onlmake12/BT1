# Q968: Low core replay reorder race in pack

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker replay, reorder, or delay conversion inputs, collection lengths, duplicate identifiers, empty values, and maximum-size payloads through a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module so `pack` in `util/gen-types/src/prelude.rs` takes a stale branch and trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input, breaking the invariant that caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `util/gen-types/src/prelude.rs::pack`
- Entrypoint: a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module
- Attacker controls: conversion inputs, collection lengths, duplicate identifiers, empty values, and maximum-size payloads
- Exploit idea: trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input
- Invariant to test: caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

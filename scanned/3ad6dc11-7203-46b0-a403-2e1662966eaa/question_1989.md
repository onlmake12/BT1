# Q1989: High network cache invalidation failure in execute

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records to alternate valid and invalid peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing so `execute` in `sync/src/synchronizer/block_process.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload, violating peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/synchronizer/block_process.rs::execute`
- Entrypoint: a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records
- Attacker controls: peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing
- Exploit idea: trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload
- Invariant to test: peer scoring, ban, discovery, and reconnection state must remain robust against adversarial inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

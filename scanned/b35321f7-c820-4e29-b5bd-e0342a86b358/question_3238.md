# Q3238: High transaction resource amplification in fmt

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries through a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block to make `fmt` in `util/types/src/core/fee_rate.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and make non-contextual, contextual, and tx-pool verification disagree about the same transaction, violating resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/core/fee_rate.rs::fmt`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block
- Attacker controls: input/output ordering, type-id positions, transaction size, cycles, and fee-rate boundaries
- Exploit idea: make non-contextual, contextual, and tx-pool verification disagree about the same transaction
- Invariant to test: resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

# Q1185: Critical crypto canonical encoding ambiguity in secp

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for Merkle leaves, proof ordering, duplicate hashes, empty roots, and MMR positions through a block relayer supplying Merkle/MMR/proof-related data at boundary lengths so `secp` in `util/crypto/src/secp/mod.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and make duplicate or empty proof elements produce a valid root for the wrong data, violating hash, Merkle, MMR, and fixed-byte conversions must be canonical across consensus and RPC paths, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `util/crypto/src/secp/mod.rs::secp`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer supplying Merkle/MMR/proof-related data at boundary lengths
- Attacker controls: Merkle leaves, proof ordering, duplicate hashes, empty roots, and MMR positions
- Exploit idea: make duplicate or empty proof elements produce a valid root for the wrong data
- Invariant to test: hash, Merkle, MMR, and fixed-byte conversions must be canonical across consensus and RPC paths
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Add a property or unit test over signatures, hashes, proofs, and encodings; assert malformed variants reject without panic.

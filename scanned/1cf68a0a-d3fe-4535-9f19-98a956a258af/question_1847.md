# Q1847: High network limit off by one in GetBlockFilterCheckPointsProcess

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses through a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks so `GetBlockFilterCheckPointsProcess` in `sync/src/filter/get_block_filter_check_points_process.rs` desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply, violating malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/filter/get_block_filter_check_points_process.rs::GetBlockFilterCheckPointsProcess`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks
- Attacker controls: header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses
- Exploit idea: desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply
- Invariant to test: malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

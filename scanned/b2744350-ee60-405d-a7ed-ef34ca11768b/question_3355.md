# Q3355: Critical txpool limit off by one in notify_new_work

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for transaction fee, size, cycles, deps, ancestor/descendant graph, orphan parents, and proposal status through a miner/RPC block-template caller assembling blocks from adversarial tx-pool state so `notify_new_work` in `miner/src/miner.rs` force quadratic graph or selection behavior with few low-cost transactions, violating tx-pool admission must remain a safe prefilter for consensus block verification, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `miner/src/miner.rs::notify_new_work`
- Entrypoint: a miner/RPC block-template caller assembling blocks from adversarial tx-pool state
- Attacker controls: transaction fee, size, cycles, deps, ancestor/descendant graph, orphan parents, and proposal status
- Exploit idea: force quadratic graph or selection behavior with few low-cost transactions
- Invariant to test: tx-pool admission must remain a safe prefilter for consensus block verification
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Simulate tx-pool submission, orphan/recent-reject transitions, and block-template assembly; assert bounded queues and consensus-valid output.

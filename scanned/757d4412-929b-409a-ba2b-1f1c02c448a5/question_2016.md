# Q2016: High network boundary divergence in HeaderAcceptor

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages and use peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing to drive `HeaderAcceptor` in `sync/src/synchronizer/headers_process.rs` across a boundary where cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied, violating the invariant that sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/synchronizer/headers_process.rs::HeaderAcceptor`
- Entrypoint: a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages
- Attacker controls: peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing
- Exploit idea: cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied
- Invariant to test: sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

# Q3503: High txpool differential path split in Display

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Display` in `tx-pool/src/component/sort_key.rs` through two production paths from a transaction sender repeatedly submitting package, orphan, replacement, and low-fee transactions and make one path accept while the other rejects because of block template limits, tx selection order, uncle candidates, proposal IDs, and fee estimator samples, violating valid user transactions must not be persistently censored by cheap attacker-created pool state, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `tx-pool/src/component/sort_key.rs::Display`
- Entrypoint: a transaction sender repeatedly submitting package, orphan, replacement, and low-fee transactions
- Attacker controls: block template limits, tx selection order, uncle candidates, proposal IDs, and fee estimator samples
- Exploit idea: make tx-pool policy accept a transaction that block verification later rejects, or reject valid traffic cheaply
- Invariant to test: valid user transactions must not be persistently censored by cheap attacker-created pool state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Simulate tx-pool submission, orphan/recent-reject transitions, and block-template assembly; assert bounded queues and consensus-valid output.

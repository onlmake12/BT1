# Q3045: High transaction resource amplification in From

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small canonical cell status before and after reorg, snapshot lookup results, and dep-group layout through a script author referencing edge-case cells, headers, DAO data, and occupied-capacity values to make `From` in `util/dao/utils/src/error.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and make dependency resolution use a different cell/header than the script-visible authorization path, violating resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `util/dao/utils/src/error.rs::From`
- Entrypoint: a script author referencing edge-case cells, headers, DAO data, and occupied-capacity values
- Attacker controls: canonical cell status before and after reorg, snapshot lookup results, and dep-group layout
- Exploit idea: make dependency resolution use a different cell/header than the script-visible authorization path
- Invariant to test: resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

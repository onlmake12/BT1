# Q3705: High vm restart reorg persistence in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape cycle limits, VM version, script hash type, loaded cell/header/tx/block-extension data through a malicious script spawning or execing child processes with adversarial inherited descriptors and pipes, then force normal restart, reorg, retry, or replay handling so `lib` in `script/src/lib.rs` persists inconsistent state and trigger a VM panic or host-side bounds error before the transaction is rejected, violating CKB-VM and syscall behavior must be deterministic and consensus-equivalent across nodes, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a malicious script spawning or execing child processes with adversarial inherited descriptors and pipes
- Attacker controls: cycle limits, VM version, script hash type, loaded cell/header/tx/block-extension data
- Exploit idea: trigger a VM panic or host-side bounds error before the transaction is rejected
- Invariant to test: CKB-VM and syscall behavior must be deterministic and consensus-equivalent across nodes
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

# Q298: Low cli limit off by one in from

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for TOML config values, resource templates, default directories, sentry/log/metrics settings, and process state through an operator-facing component processing log, metrics, memory, runtime, or launcher state so `from` in `util/memory-tracker/src/rocksdb.rs` make generated defaults enable an unsafe resource or performance behavior in normal operation, violating import/export/replay/migration behavior must match production validation and storage invariants, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `util/memory-tracker/src/rocksdb.rs::from`
- Entrypoint: an operator-facing component processing log, metrics, memory, runtime, or launcher state
- Attacker controls: TOML config values, resource templates, default directories, sentry/log/metrics settings, and process state
- Exploit idea: make generated defaults enable an unsafe resource or performance behavior in normal operation
- Invariant to test: import/export/replay/migration behavior must match production validation and storage invariants
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Run the supported CLI/config path in a temp directory with crafted local input; assert clean error, no state corruption, and bounded runtime.

# Q377: Critical consensus cross module inconsistency in new

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects to make `new` in `chain/src/init.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make fork-choice or delayed verification commit a block whose derived roots or epoch data disagree with recalculation, violating all honest nodes must deterministically accept and reject the same blocks under the same consensus spec, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/src/init.rs::new`
- Entrypoint: an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects
- Attacker controls: uncle lists, proposal IDs, block extension bytes, transaction roots, and DAO fields
- Exploit idea: make fork-choice or delayed verification commit a block whose derived roots or epoch data disagree with recalculation
- Invariant to test: all honest nodes must deterministically accept and reject the same blocks under the same consensus spec
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash the whole CKB network
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

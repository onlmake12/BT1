# Q717: High core cross module inconsistency in prelude

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module to make `prelude` in `error/src/prelude.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make canonical serialization or conversion accept an ambiguous representation, violating module-level assumptions must hold across consensus, network, RPC, storage, and tx-pool paths, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `error/src/prelude.rs::prelude`
- Entrypoint: a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module
- Attacker controls: local config or RPC parameters that flow into production node behavior
- Exploit idea: make canonical serialization or conversion accept an ambiguous representation
- Invariant to test: module-level assumptions must hold across consensus, network, RPC, storage, and tx-pool paths
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

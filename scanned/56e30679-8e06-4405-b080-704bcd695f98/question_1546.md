# Q1546: High network resource amplification in Request

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker repeatedly send small header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses through a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages to make `Request` in `network/src/peer_store/browser.rs` amplify CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth and desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply, violating P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/peer_store/browser.rs::Request`
- Entrypoint: a remote P2P peer sending crafted framed messages
- Attacker controls: header batches, block locators, compact-block short IDs, transaction indexes, and missing-data responses
- Exploit idea: desynchronize relay or sync state so valid blocks/transactions stop propagating cheaply
- Invariant to test: P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

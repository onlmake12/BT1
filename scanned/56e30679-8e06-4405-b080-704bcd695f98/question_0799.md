# Q799: High core cross module inconsistency in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use an unprivileged peer, RPC caller, or transaction sender reaching this shared module through production paths to make `lib` in `util/constant/src/lib.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make canonical serialization or conversion accept an ambiguous representation, violating security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/constant/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: an unprivileged peer, RPC caller, or transaction sender reaching this shared module through production paths
- Attacker controls: serialized CKB objects, hashes, indexes, ranges, counts, options, and boundary numeric values
- Exploit idea: make canonical serialization or conversion accept an ambiguous representation
- Invariant to test: security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

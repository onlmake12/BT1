# Q365: Critical consensus cross module inconsistency in insert_block

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects to make `insert_block` in `chain/src/chain_service.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where make contextual verification consume stale parent or epoch state after a reorg/orphan transition, violating invalid PoW, epoch, uncle, proposal, extension, DAO, or root data must never become canonical, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/src/chain_service.rs::insert_block`
- Entrypoint: an RPC block submitter feeding locally generated consensus objects
- Attacker controls: genesis/spec fields on a private chain and canonical block metadata during replay
- Exploit idea: make contextual verification consume stale parent or epoch state after a reorg/orphan transition
- Invariant to test: invalid PoW, epoch, uncle, proposal, extension, DAO, or root data must never become canonical
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Build a focused unit or integration test with the target verifier and a private-chain consensus spec; assert identical accept/reject results before and after reorg/restart.

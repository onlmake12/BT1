# Q1277: Critical crypto cache invalidation failure in Default

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a peer relaying network alerts or consensus objects with adversarial cryptographic encodings to alternate valid and invalid network-alert payload bytes, serialization format, byte order, and fixed-hash lengths so `Default` in `util/fixed-hash/core/src/std_default.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and panic or overrun a cryptographic parser before a malformed object is rejected, violating hash, Merkle, MMR, and fixed-byte conversions must be canonical across consensus and RPC paths, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `util/fixed-hash/core/src/std_default.rs::Default`
- Entrypoint: a peer relaying network alerts or consensus objects with adversarial cryptographic encodings
- Attacker controls: network-alert payload bytes, serialization format, byte order, and fixed-hash lengths
- Exploit idea: panic or overrun a cryptographic parser before a malformed object is rejected
- Invariant to test: hash, Merkle, MMR, and fixed-byte conversions must be canonical across consensus and RPC paths
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Add a property or unit test over signatures, hashes, proofs, and encodings; assert malformed variants reject without panic.

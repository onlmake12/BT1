# Q2217: High rpc cache invalidation failure in lib

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters to alternate valid and invalid JSON numbers, hashes, block ranges, script/search keys, order flags, limits, cursors, and subscriptions so `lib` in `util/indexer/src/lib.rs` leaves a cache, index, or status flag stale and return stale or inconsistent security-relevant state after reorg, restart, or concurrent indexing, violating RPC/indexer/helper state must match canonical chain state after reorg, restart, and pagination, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/indexer/src/lib.rs::lib`
- Entrypoint: a local RPC caller invoking public JSON-RPC methods with crafted parameters
- Attacker controls: JSON numbers, hashes, block ranges, script/search keys, order flags, limits, cursors, and subscriptions
- Exploit idea: return stale or inconsistent security-relevant state after reorg, restart, or concurrent indexing
- Invariant to test: RPC/indexer/helper state must match canonical chain state after reorg, restart, and pagination
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.

# Q1725: High network state transition mismatch in register

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks and sequence peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing so `register` in `network/src/protocols/identify/mod.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied, violating P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/protocols/identify/mod.rs::register`
- Entrypoint: a sync peer delivering oversized, reordered, or inconsistent headers/blocks/compact blocks
- Attacker controls: peer IDs, multiaddrs, discovery counts, timestamps, ban/score-relevant fields, and connection timing
- Exploit idea: cause high CPU or memory work before frame/message limits and peer punishment are applied
- Invariant to test: P2P inputs must be bounded, deterministic, and rejected before expensive work or state mutation
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities or bad designs which could cause CKB network congestion with few costs
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

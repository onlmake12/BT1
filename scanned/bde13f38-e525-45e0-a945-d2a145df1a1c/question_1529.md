# Q1529: High network cross module inconsistency in contains

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records to make `contains` in `network/src/peer_store/anchors.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload, violating malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `network/src/peer_store/anchors.rs::contains`
- Entrypoint: a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records
- Attacker controls: message ordering, retry timing, duplicate announcements, partial payloads, and boundary vector lengths
- Exploit idea: trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload
- Invariant to test: malformed peer data must not crash a node or create low-cost network congestion
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

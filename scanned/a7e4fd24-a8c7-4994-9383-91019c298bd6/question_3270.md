# Q3270: High transaction state transition mismatch in [

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block and sequence cell deps, header deps, witnesses, lock/type args, output data lengths, and capacity values so `[` in `util/types/src/core/hardfork/helper.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization, violating resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/core/hardfork/helper.rs::[`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block
- Attacker controls: cell deps, header deps, witnesses, lock/type args, output data lengths, and capacity values
- Exploit idea: bypass a conservation, maturity, since, or occupied-capacity check through boundary serialization
- Invariant to test: resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Incorrect implementation or behavior of CKB-VM or system scripts
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

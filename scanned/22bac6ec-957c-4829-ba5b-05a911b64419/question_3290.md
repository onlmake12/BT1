# Q3290: Critical transaction parser precheck gap in core

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit malformed-but-reachable maturity height, since flags, DAO fields, resolved transaction data, and duplicate dependencies through a transaction sender submitting crafted inputs, outputs, deps, witnesses, and since values so `core` in `util/types/src/core/mod.rs` performs expensive or unsafe work before validation and make non-contextual, contextual, and tx-pool verification disagree about the same transaction, violating resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/core/mod.rs::core`
- Entrypoint: a transaction sender submitting crafted inputs, outputs, deps, witnesses, and since values
- Attacker controls: maturity height, since flags, DAO fields, resolved transaction data, and duplicate dependencies
- Exploit idea: make non-contextual, contextual, and tx-pool verification disagree about the same transaction
- Invariant to test: resolved transaction data must bind exactly to the canonical cells and headers used by scripts
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

# Q728: High core parser precheck gap in other

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit malformed-but-reachable serialized CKB objects, hashes, indexes, ranges, counts, options, and boundary numeric values through a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data so `other` in `error/src/util.rs` performs expensive or unsafe work before validation and trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input, violating caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `error/src/util.rs::other`
- Entrypoint: a script or network payload causing production code to parse, convert, or cache attacker-shaped data
- Attacker controls: serialized CKB objects, hashes, indexes, ranges, counts, options, and boundary numeric values
- Exploit idea: trigger panic, overflow, stale cache, or excessive work before caller-level validation handles the input
- Invariant to test: caller-controlled input must not cause panic, ambiguous conversion, stale state, or unbounded work
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

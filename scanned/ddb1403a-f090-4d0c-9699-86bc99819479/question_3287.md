# Q3287: Critical transaction canonical encoding ambiguity in core

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft alternate encodings for maturity height, since flags, DAO fields, resolved transaction data, and duplicate dependencies through a tx-pool submitter racing mempool admission against chain reorg or cell status changes so `core` in `util/types/src/core/mod.rs` accepts two representations for one security object and create a state transition where capacity or spendability changes without a matching valid authorization, violating capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/core/mod.rs::core`
- Entrypoint: a tx-pool submitter racing mempool admission against chain reorg or cell status changes
- Attacker controls: maturity height, since flags, DAO fields, resolved transaction data, and duplicate dependencies
- Exploit idea: create a state transition where capacity or spendability changes without a matching valid authorization
- Invariant to test: capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

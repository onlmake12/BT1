# Q1960: High network state transition mismatch in connected

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records and sequence compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs so `connected` in `sync/src/relayer/mod.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload, violating sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `sync/src/relayer/mod.rs::connected`
- Entrypoint: a discovery peer advertising adversarial addresses and node records
- Attacker controls: compressed frame flags, length prefixes, snappy payloads, Molecule message bytes, and protocol IDs
- Exploit idea: trigger a parser or protocol-state panic with a single malformed peer-controlled payload
- Invariant to test: sync/relay state must not accept invalid messages or reject valid data because of peer ordering tricks
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Use a protocol/codec unit test or fuzz harness with attacker-controlled bytes and assert bounded work, no panic, and expected peer punishment.

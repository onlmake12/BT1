# Q3221: Critical transaction state transition mismatch in EstimateMode

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block and sequence cell deps, header deps, witnesses, lock/type args, output data lengths, and capacity values so `EstimateMode` in `util/types/src/core/fee_estimator.rs` observes pre-state and post-state from different views, letting the flow make non-contextual, contextual, and tx-pool verification disagree about the same transaction, violating capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy?

## Target
- File/function: `util/types/src/core/fee_estimator.rs::EstimateMode`
- Entrypoint: a block relayer including dependency-heavy transactions in an otherwise valid block
- Attacker controls: cell deps, header deps, witnesses, lock/type args, output data lengths, and capacity values
- Exploit idea: make non-contextual, contextual, and tx-pool verification disagree about the same transaction
- Invariant to test: capacity must be conserved and occupied-capacity, maturity, and since rules must be deterministic
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily damage CKB economy
- Fast validation: Create a local transaction/block verification harness with crafted resolved cells and compare tx-pool, non-contextual, and contextual results.

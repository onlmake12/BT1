# Q705: Low core limit off by one in new

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose exact minimum, maximum, empty, duplicate, or plus-one values for conversion inputs, collection lengths, duplicate identifiers, empty values, and maximum-size payloads through a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module so `new` in `error/src/internal.rs` break a resource bound or state transition that downstream modules assume is already enforced, violating security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers, causing Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB?

## Target
- File/function: `error/src/internal.rs::new`
- Entrypoint: a local operator invoking a default-enabled node path that depends on this module
- Attacker controls: conversion inputs, collection lengths, duplicate identifiers, empty values, and maximum-size payloads
- Exploit idea: break a resource bound or state transition that downstream modules assume is already enforced
- Invariant to test: security-relevant data must preserve identity and validity across serialization and conversion layers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low (501 - 2000 points). Any other important performance improvements for CKB
- Fast validation: Create a minimal caller harness for the shared module and compare outputs across boundary inputs, serialization forms, and repeated calls.

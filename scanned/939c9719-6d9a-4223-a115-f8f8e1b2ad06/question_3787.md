# Q3787: Critical vm parser precheck gap in initialize

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit malformed-but-reachable RISC-V bytecode, argv/env, witness bytes, syscall offsets, lengths, indexes, and source selectors through a transaction sender deploying a crafted CKB-VM script and witness payload so `initialize` in `script/src/syscalls/inherited_fd.rs` performs expensive or unsafe work before validation and make VM version gating select the wrong behavior at a hardfork boundary, violating scripts must see exactly the resolved cells, headers, witnesses, and block extensions committed by consensus, causing Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation?

## Target
- File/function: `script/src/syscalls/inherited_fd.rs::initialize`
- Entrypoint: a transaction sender deploying a crafted CKB-VM script and witness payload
- Attacker controls: RISC-V bytecode, argv/env, witness bytes, syscall offsets, lengths, indexes, and source selectors
- Exploit idea: make VM version gating select the wrong behavior at a hardfork boundary
- Invariant to test: scripts must see exactly the resolved cells, headers, witnesses, and block extensions committed by consensus
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical (15001 - 25000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily cause consensus deviation
- Fast validation: Add a CKB-VM syscall/script regression test with boundary arguments and assert return code, cycles, and script-visible bytes.

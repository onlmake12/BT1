# Q2304: High rpc cross module inconsistency in ResponseFormat

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use an indexer/RPC client requesting adversarial ranges, filters, cursors, and pagination values to make `ResponseFormat` in `util/jsonrpc-types/src/lib.rs` return a result that downstream modules interpret differently, where return stale or inconsistent security-relevant state after reorg, restart, or concurrent indexing, violating local RPC APIs must validate all caller-controlled parameters and fail without process crash, causing High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node?

## Target
- File/function: `util/jsonrpc-types/src/lib.rs::ResponseFormat`
- Entrypoint: an indexer/RPC client requesting adversarial ranges, filters, cursors, and pagination values
- Attacker controls: indexer state freshness, reorg timing, block-filter requests, and proof target positions
- Exploit idea: return stale or inconsistent security-relevant state after reorg, restart, or concurrent indexing
- Invariant to test: local RPC APIs must validate all caller-controlled parameters and fail without process crash
- Expected Immunefi impact: High (10001 - 15000 points). Vulnerabilities which could easily crash a CKB node
- Fast validation: Run a local RPC/indexer test with crafted JSON parameters and reorg timing; assert no panic and canonical, bounded responses.
